Logan Nathaniel Bowman was reported missing in Grayson County in January 2003. As the search for the boy dragged on, authorities charged his mother, Cynthia Davis, and her then-boyfriend, Dennis Schermerhorn, in his disappearance, according to WSLS.

Davis was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 2003, per Grayson County Circuit Court records, but the boy's body was never found. Murder charges against Schermerhorn were dismissed in 2004 due to a lack of evidence, WSLS reported.

In September last year, a child's skeletal remains, which had been in the area 'for an extended period of time,' were recovered in a wooded area of Galax, Virginia, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.



A man from out of town reportedly found the remains after buying the property, per WSLS. Carroll County Sheriff Kevin Kemp told the outlet that the long-missing boy came to mind at the time of the gruesome discovery.

'It was a day where I first thought, ‘What if these could be the remains of Logan Bowman?'' Kemp said.

Last week, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office announced that Othram Inc. identified the remains as Logan's by using forensic genome sequencing.

'This is still an ongoing investigation with new charges anticipated,' the department wrote.

'I want people to know that we don't give up. And you may not know every little thing going on, it may be quiet for a little while, but this is proof that just because you don't hear something every single week, it doesn't mean there's not work being done,' Kemp told WSLS of the announcement.

'We'll do everything we can to press whatever charges need to be pressed,' he said.

Kemp said he wasn't surprised when Othram shared their findings.

'These are very rare circumstances that do not happen very often, so we understand the importance and the rarity of this circumstance,' Kemp said of the state of the remains. 'So to say I'm not in shock with the outcome, I think would be understating it a little bit.'

Logan was last seen at his home on Jan. 2, 2003, according to the Doe Network.

Bestseller Sandra Brown Tackles One of Society's Biggest Tragedies in New Thriller | Article by Dawn Ius


With Sandra Brown's latest novel, 
Out of Nowhere
 — an emotional powerhouse that deftly tackles one of our current society's biggest controversies and tragedies — Brown admits she feared the topic might alienate readers, even some of her long-standing fans. The story kicks off with a mass shooting at a Texas county fair. Unfortunately, this isn't an occurrence that only happens in fiction — there have been more than 200 in the U.S. this year so far — and Brown worried it might hit too close to home for some.

Those fears are amplified by a booming

 genre and the rising popularity of web sleuths, which can even create local boogeymen.


For decades, LISK – the Long Island Serial Killer – was a ghost story, until Rex Heuermann was arrested over the summer and charged with three of the '
Gilgo Beach 4
' murders. However, unexplained questions are still filled with myths and theories.


In Portland, Oregon,
 and around Lady Bird Lake in Austin, Texas, several mysterious deaths and disappearances led to active fears of a roaming serial killer, or killers, despite law enforcement's denial of these claims. 


REX HEUERMANN'S PECULIAR CONNECTION TO ‘MANORVILLE BUTCHER' AND VICTIMS' SCATTERED BODY PARTS
 
Lady Bird Lake


As of late June, five men were found dead this year in the social hot spot of 
downtown Austin
, where their bodies have been found in and around the infamous lake. 


The victims were men, and most were fished out of the lake or found dead along the shore. 





Several other lives have been claimed around that 
Texas lake
 in the last couple of years, and others have survived strange scenarios there with no recollection of what happened. 


The community's cries of a lurking killer preying on men had been downplayed for months by local police, who have said the incidents have been 'accidental' and 'coincidental.' 
 
Victims' families packed an Austin City Council hearing in April to push municipal leaders to take action. 


Whether rumors of a predator are true or not, it is a fact that several men died in and around the lake in a short amount of time.





'There are too many people that have gone missing,' resident Christopher Pugh said during April's city council meeting. 


Pugh's 21-year-old son was 
reported missing
 in November 2019 after a night out on Rainey Street and was found days later with 'serious' injuries by the lake.


'There are too many people that have been injured,' he said. 'There are too many people that can walk off, and we still have absolutely no answers as to what has happened to any of those folks.'


Portland women vanish


Police found the remains of at least six women, including 32-year-old Joanna Speaks, whose death was 
ruled a homicide,
 were found within 100 miles of the Portland area.

Logan Nathaniel Bowman was reported missing in Grayson County in January 2003. As the search for the boy dragged on, authorities charged his mother, Cynthia Davis, and her then-boyfriend, Dennis Schermerhorn, in his disappearance, according to WSLS.

Davis was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 2003, per Grayson County Circuit Court records, but the boy's body was never found. Murder charges against Schermerhorn were dismissed in 2004 due to a lack of evidence, WSLS reported.

In September last year, a child's skeletal remains, which had been in the area 'for an extended period of time,' were recovered in a wooded area of Galax, Virginia, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.



A man from out of town reportedly found the remains after buying the property, per WSLS. Carroll County Sheriff Kevin Kemp told the outlet that the long-missing boy came to mind at the time of the gruesome discovery.

'It was a day where I first thought, ‘What if these could be the remains of Logan Bowman?'' Kemp said.

Last week, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office announced that Othram Inc. identified the remains as Logan's by using forensic genome sequencing.

'This is still an ongoing investigation with new charges anticipated,' the department wrote.

'I want people to know that we don't give up. And you may not know every little thing going on, it may be quiet for a little while, but this is proof that just because you don't hear something every single week, it doesn't mean there's not work being done,' Kemp told WSLS of the announcement.

'We'll do everything we can to press whatever charges need to be pressed,' he said.

Kemp said he wasn't surprised when Othram shared their findings.

'These are very rare circumstances that do not happen very often, so we understand the importance and the rarity of this circumstance,' Kemp said of the state of the remains. 'So to say I'm not in shock with the outcome, I think would be understating it a little bit.'

Logan was last seen at his home on Jan. 2, 2003, according to the Doe Network.

REX HEUERMANN'S PECULIAR CONNECTION TO ‘MANORVILLE BUTCHER' AND VICTIMS' SCATTERED BODY PARTS
 
Lady Bird Lake


As of late June, five men were found dead this year in the social hot spot of 
downtown Austin
, where their bodies have been found in and around the infamous lake. 


The victims were men, and most were fished out of the lake or found dead along the shore. 





Several other lives have been claimed around that 
Texas lake
 in the last couple of years, and others have survived strange scenarios there with no recollection of what happened. 


The community's cries of a lurking killer preying on men had been downplayed for months by local police, who have said the incidents have been 'accidental' and 'coincidental.' 
 
Victims' families packed an Austin City Council hearing in April to push municipal leaders to take action. 


Whether rumors of a predator are true or not, it is a fact that several men died in and around the lake in a short amount of time.





'There are too many people that have gone missing,' resident Christopher Pugh said during April's city council meeting. 


Pugh's 21-year-old son was 
reported missing
 in November 2019 after a night out on Rainey Street and was found days later with 'serious' injuries by the lake.


'There are too many people that have been injured,' he said. 'There are too many people that can walk off, and we still have absolutely no answers as to what has happened to any of those folks.'


Portland women vanish


Police found the remains of at least six women, including 32-year-old Joanna Speaks, whose death was 
ruled a homicide,
 were found within 100 miles of the Portland area.

Logan Nathaniel Bowman was reported missing in Grayson County in January 2003. As the search for the boy dragged on, authorities charged his mother, Cynthia Davis, and her then-boyfriend, Dennis Schermerhorn, in his disappearance, according to WSLS.

Davis was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 2003, per Grayson County Circuit Court records, but the boy's body was never found. Murder charges against Schermerhorn were dismissed in 2004 due to a lack of evidence, WSLS reported.

In September last year, a child's skeletal remains, which had been in the area 'for an extended period of time,' were recovered in a wooded area of Galax, Virginia, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.



A man from out of town reportedly found the remains after buying the property, per WSLS. Carroll County Sheriff Kevin Kemp told the outlet that the long-missing boy came to mind at the time of the gruesome discovery.

'It was a day where I first thought, ‘What if these could be the remains of Logan Bowman?'' Kemp said.

Last week, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office announced that Othram Inc. identified the remains as Logan's by using forensic genome sequencing.

'This is still an ongoing investigation with new charges anticipated,' the department wrote.

'I want people to know that we don't give up. And you may not know every little thing going on, it may be quiet for a little while, but this is proof that just because you don't hear something every single week, it doesn't mean there's not work being done,' Kemp told WSLS of the announcement.

'We'll do everything we can to press whatever charges need to be pressed,' he said.

Kemp said he wasn't surprised when Othram shared their findings.

'These are very rare circumstances that do not happen very often, so we understand the importance and the rarity of this circumstance,' Kemp said of the state of the remains. 'So to say I'm not in shock with the outcome, I think would be understating it a little bit.'

Logan was last seen at his home on Jan. 2, 2003, according to the Doe Network.

Logan Nathaniel Bowman was reported missing in Grayson County in January 2003. As the search for the boy dragged on, authorities charged his mother, Cynthia Davis, and her then-boyfriend, Dennis Schermerhorn, in his disappearance, according to WSLS.

Davis was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 2003, per Grayson County Circuit Court records, but the boy's body was never found. Murder charges against Schermerhorn were dismissed in 2004 due to a lack of evidence, WSLS reported.

In September last year, a child's skeletal remains, which had been in the area 'for an extended period of time,' were recovered in a wooded area of Galax, Virginia, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.



A man from out of town reportedly found the remains after buying the property, per WSLS. Carroll County Sheriff Kevin Kemp told the outlet that the long-missing boy came to mind at the time of the gruesome discovery.

'It was a day where I first thought, ‘What if these could be the remains of Logan Bowman?'' Kemp said.

Last week, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office announced that Othram Inc. identified the remains as Logan's by using forensic genome sequencing.

'This is still an ongoing investigation with new charges anticipated,' the department wrote.

'I want people to know that we don't give up. And you may not know every little thing going on, it may be quiet for a little while, but this is proof that just because you don't hear something every single week, it doesn't mean there's not work being done,' Kemp told WSLS of the announcement.

'We'll do everything we can to press whatever charges need to be pressed,' he said.

Kemp said he wasn't surprised when Othram shared their findings.

'These are very rare circumstances that do not happen very often, so we understand the importance and the rarity of this circumstance,' Kemp said of the state of the remains. 'So to say I'm not in shock with the outcome, I think would be understating it a little bit.'

Logan was last seen at his home on Jan. 2, 2003, according to the Doe Network.

Bestseller Sandra Brown Tackles One of Society's Biggest Tragedies in New Thriller | Article by Dawn Ius


With Sandra Brown's latest novel, 
Out of Nowhere
 — an emotional powerhouse that deftly tackles one of our current society's biggest controversies and tragedies — Brown admits she feared the topic might alienate readers, even some of her long-standing fans. The story kicks off with a mass shooting at a Texas county fair. Unfortunately, this isn't an occurrence that only happens in fiction — there have been more than 200 in the U.S. this year so far — and Brown worried it might hit too close to home for some.

Logan Nathaniel Bowman was reported missing in Grayson County in January 2003. As the search for the boy dragged on, authorities charged his mother, Cynthia Davis, and her then-boyfriend, Dennis Schermerhorn, in his disappearance, according to WSLS.

Davis was convicted on second-degree murder charges in 2003, per Grayson County Circuit Court records, but the boy's body was never found. Murder charges against Schermerhorn were dismissed in 2004 due to a lack of evidence, WSLS reported.

In September last year, a child's skeletal remains, which had been in the area 'for an extended period of time,' were recovered in a wooded area of Galax, Virginia, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post.



A man from out of town reportedly found the remains after buying the property, per WSLS. Carroll County Sheriff Kevin Kemp told the outlet that the long-missing boy came to mind at the time of the gruesome discovery.

'It was a day where I first thought, ‘What if these could be the remains of Logan Bowman?'' Kemp said.

Last week, the Carroll County Sheriff's Office announced that Othram Inc. identified the remains as Logan's by using forensic genome sequencing.

'This is still an ongoing investigation with new charges anticipated,' the department wrote.

'I want people to know that we don't give up. And you may not know every little thing going on, it may be quiet for a little while, but this is proof that just because you don't hear something every single week, it doesn't mean there's not work being done,' Kemp told WSLS of the announcement.

'We'll do everything we can to press whatever charges need to be pressed,' he said.

Kemp said he wasn't surprised when Othram shared their findings.

'These are very rare circumstances that do not happen very often, so we understand the importance and the rarity of this circumstance,' Kemp said of the state of the remains. 'So to say I'm not in shock with the outcome, I think would be understating it a little bit.'

Logan was last seen at his home on Jan. 2, 2003, according to the Doe Network.

The health impact of something as pervasive as air pollution can be hard to communicate due to the complex nature of its effects on humans. This makes it a challenge to convey the full extent of its consequences to the general public.

However, satellite-derived data from from the 2023 Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) shows how exposure to particulate matter in the air can impact average life expectancy of residents in different cities.

Using this data, Aarsh Batra visualizes a map of life expectancy gains (the deeper the hue, the higher the gain) if all people around the world breathed cleaner air.

Top 500 Cities By Life Expectancy Gains From Cleaner Air

Consistent exposure to particulate matter in the air with a width of 2.5 micrometers, or PM2.5, can lead to strokes, heart attacks, and an increased risk of lung disease. The WHO recommended guideline for annual average PM2.5 levels is below 5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

If particle pollution levels in 2021 had matched WHO guidelines around the world, life expectancy on average on the planet would have increased by more than 2 years.

In some cities however, gains are much higher, indicating how much worse their air quality was.

Consistent exposure to particulate matter in the air with a width of 2.5 micrometers, or PM2.5, can lead to strokes, heart attacks, and an increased risk of lung disease. The WHO recommended guideline for annual average PM2.5 levels is below 5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

If particle pollution levels in 2021 had matched WHO guidelines around the world, life expectancy on average on the planet would have increased by more than 2 years.

In some cities however, gains are much higher, indicating how much worse their air quality was.

The health impact of something as pervasive as air pollution can be hard to communicate due to the complex nature of its effects on humans. This makes it a challenge to convey the full extent of its consequences to the general public.

However, satellite-derived data from from the 2023 Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) shows how exposure to particulate matter in the air can impact average life expectancy of residents in different cities.

Using this data, Aarsh Batra visualizes a map of life expectancy gains (the deeper the hue, the higher the gain) if all people around the world breathed cleaner air.

Top 500 Cities By Life Expectancy Gains From Cleaner Air

Consistent exposure to particulate matter in the air with a width of 2.5 micrometers, or PM2.5, can lead to strokes, heart attacks, and an increased risk of lung disease. The WHO recommended guideline for annual average PM2.5 levels is below 5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

If particle pollution levels in 2021 had matched WHO guidelines around the world, life expectancy on average on the planet would have increased by more than 2 years.

In some cities however, gains are much higher, indicating how much worse their air quality was.

The health impact of something as pervasive as air pollution can be hard to communicate due to the complex nature of its effects on humans. This makes it a challenge to convey the full extent of its consequences to the general public.

However, satellite-derived data from from the 2023 Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) shows how exposure to particulate matter in the air can impact average life expectancy of residents in different cities.

Using this data, Aarsh Batra visualizes a map of life expectancy gains (the deeper the hue, the higher the gain) if all people around the world breathed cleaner air.

Top 500 Cities By Life Expectancy Gains From Cleaner Air

Consistent exposure to particulate matter in the air with a width of 2.5 micrometers, or PM2.5, can lead to strokes, heart attacks, and an increased risk of lung disease. The WHO recommended guideline for annual average PM2.5 levels is below 5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

If particle pollution levels in 2021 had matched WHO guidelines around the world, life expectancy on average on the planet would have increased by more than 2 years.

In some cities however, gains are much higher, indicating how much worse their air quality was.

Using this data, Aarsh Batra visualizes a map of life expectancy gains (the deeper the hue, the higher the gain) if all people around the world breathed cleaner air.

Top 500 Cities By Life Expectancy Gains From Cleaner Air

Consistent exposure to particulate matter in the air with a width of 2.5 micrometers, or PM2.5, can lead to strokes, heart attacks, and an increased risk of lung disease. The WHO recommended guideline for annual average PM2.5 levels is below 5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

If particle pollution levels in 2021 had matched WHO guidelines around the world, life expectancy on average on the planet would have increased by more than 2 years.

In some cities however, gains are much higher, indicating how much worse their air quality was.

The health impact of something as pervasive as air pollution can be hard to communicate due to the complex nature of its effects on humans. This makes it a challenge to convey the full extent of its consequences to the general public.

However, satellite-derived data from from the 2023 Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) shows how exposure to particulate matter in the air can impact average life expectancy of residents in different cities.

Using this data, Aarsh Batra visualizes a map of life expectancy gains (the deeper the hue, the higher the gain) if all people around the world breathed cleaner air.

Top 500 Cities By Life Expectancy Gains From Cleaner Air

Consistent exposure to particulate matter in the air with a width of 2.5 micrometers, or PM2.5, can lead to strokes, heart attacks, and an increased risk of lung disease. The WHO recommended guideline for annual average PM2.5 levels is below 5 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).

If particle pollution levels in 2021 had matched WHO guidelines around the world, life expectancy on average on the planet would have increased by more than 2 years.

In some cities however, gains are much higher, indicating how much worse their air quality was.

KUCHING, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Petronas Dagangan Berhad is mobilising additional diesel supplies to Sarawak within two days after supply of the fuel was disrupted at Petronas-owned stations in the state, said Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali. He said Petronas was required to provide a list of petrol stations involved in the delivery of additional supplies.

"This is to enable comprehensive monitoring to be made," he said in a WhatsApp message to Bernama here today.

HEALTH Minister Terrence Deyalsingh is confident that the San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH) will be fully refurbushed and modernised by 2025.

He expressed this confidence to the media during a visit to the SFGH on Tuesday.

Deyalsingh reminded the media that a sum of $34 million has been allocated in the public sector investment programme (PSIP) for the current fiscal year to improve the infrastructure and facilities at SFGH, Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex and the Port of Spain General Hospital.

He said additional money will be placed in the PSIP for the next fiscal year to continue those works.

Deyalsingh directed the media's attention to the plethora of scaffolding on site at the SFGH to show that the upgrade of the hospital has already begun.

That work, he continued, included replacing the roof tiles and modernising the wards.

"It (SFGH) is going to be a world class facility in the next two years."

Deyalsingh lamented that all three hospitals had fallen into disrepair over the last few decades.

He reiterated that by 2025, SFGH "is going to be totally refurbished modernised and it will result in a better delivery of health care services."

Deyalsingh identified better environments for patients and higher motivation for staff as two other benefits to come from a modernised SFGH.

Acting South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) CEO Stephen Alleyne elaborated on the work taking place at the hospital.

He said the wards on the 3rd floor of the hospital have been decanted, work has started on that floor and is gradually moving down one floor at a time.

Alleyne said the new hospital will have better labour, antenatal and postnatal wards.

The quality of the SFGH's 700 bed stock will be improved, the entire hospital will be air-conditoned and further expansions will be made to its accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Deyalsingh said this department was already expanded five years ago to treat patients who did not require hospitalisation.

He was confident that the Augustus Long Hospital (ALH) , which was "gifted" by Heritage Petroleum Ltd to SWRHA, will be operationalised as the SFGH's new oncology centre next June-July.

Deyalsingh said the existing oncology facility at SFGH left a lot to be desired for patients and their families.

He added that a palliative care unit will also be established at ALH for cancer patients in end of life stage.

KUCHING, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Petronas Dagangan Berhad is mobilising additional diesel supplies to Sarawak within two days after supply of the fuel was disrupted at Petronas-owned stations in the state, said Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali. He said Petronas was required to provide a list of petrol stations involved in the delivery of additional supplies.

"This is to enable comprehensive monitoring to be made," he said in a WhatsApp message to Bernama here today.

HEALTH Minister Terrence Deyalsingh is confident that the San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH) will be fully refurbushed and modernised by 2025.

He expressed this confidence to the media during a visit to the SFGH on Tuesday.

Deyalsingh reminded the media that a sum of $34 million has been allocated in the public sector investment programme (PSIP) for the current fiscal year to improve the infrastructure and facilities at SFGH, Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex and the Port of Spain General Hospital.

He said additional money will be placed in the PSIP for the next fiscal year to continue those works.

Deyalsingh directed the media's attention to the plethora of scaffolding on site at the SFGH to show that the upgrade of the hospital has already begun.

That work, he continued, included replacing the roof tiles and modernising the wards.

"It (SFGH) is going to be a world class facility in the next two years."

Deyalsingh lamented that all three hospitals had fallen into disrepair over the last few decades.

He reiterated that by 2025, SFGH "is going to be totally refurbished modernised and it will result in a better delivery of health care services."

Deyalsingh identified better environments for patients and higher motivation for staff as two other benefits to come from a modernised SFGH.

Acting South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) CEO Stephen Alleyne elaborated on the work taking place at the hospital.

He said the wards on the 3rd floor of the hospital have been decanted, work has started on that floor and is gradually moving down one floor at a time.

Alleyne said the new hospital will have better labour, antenatal and postnatal wards.

The quality of the SFGH's 700 bed stock will be improved, the entire hospital will be air-conditoned and further expansions will be made to its accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Deyalsingh said this department was already expanded five years ago to treat patients who did not require hospitalisation.

He was confident that the Augustus Long Hospital (ALH) , which was "gifted" by Heritage Petroleum Ltd to SWRHA, will be operationalised as the SFGH's new oncology centre next June-July.

Deyalsingh said the existing oncology facility at SFGH left a lot to be desired for patients and their families.

He added that a palliative care unit will also be established at ALH for cancer patients in end of life stage.

KUCHING, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Petronas Dagangan Berhad is mobilising additional diesel supplies to Sarawak within two days after supply of the fuel was disrupted at Petronas-owned stations in the state, said Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali. He said Petronas was required to provide a list of petrol stations involved in the delivery of additional supplies.

- Jeff K. Mayers

HEALTH Minister Terrence Deyalsingh is confident that the San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH) will be fully refurbushed and modernised by 2025.

He expressed this confidence to the media during a visit to the SFGH on Tuesday.

Deyalsingh reminded the media that a sum of $34 million has been allocated in the public sector investment programme (PSIP) for the current fiscal year to improve the infrastructure and facilities at SFGH, Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex and the Port of Spain General Hospital.

He said additional money will be placed in the PSIP for the next fiscal year to continue those works.

Deyalsingh directed the media's attention to the plethora of scaffolding on site at the SFGH to show that the upgrade of the hospital has already begun.

That work, he continued, included replacing the roof tiles and modernising the wards.

"It (SFGH) is going to be a world class facility in the next two years."

Deyalsingh lamented that all three hospitals had fallen into disrepair over the last few decades.

He reiterated that by 2025, SFGH "is going to be totally refurbished modernised and it will result in a better delivery of health care services."

Deyalsingh identified better environments for patients and higher motivation for staff as two other benefits to come from a modernised SFGH.

Acting South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) CEO Stephen Alleyne elaborated on the work taking place at the hospital.

He said the wards on the 3rd floor of the hospital have been decanted, work has started on that floor and is gradually moving down one floor at a time.

Alleyne said the new hospital will have better labour, antenatal and postnatal wards.

The quality of the SFGH's 700 bed stock will be improved, the entire hospital will be air-conditoned and further expansions will be made to its accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Deyalsingh said this department was already expanded five years ago to treat patients who did not require hospitalisation.

He was confident that the Augustus Long Hospital (ALH) , which was "gifted" by Heritage Petroleum Ltd to SWRHA, will be operationalised as the SFGH's new oncology centre next June-July.

Deyalsingh said the existing oncology facility at SFGH left a lot to be desired for patients and their families.

He added that a palliative care unit will also be established at ALH for cancer patients in end of life stage.

- Jeff K. Mayers

HEALTH Minister Terrence Deyalsingh is confident that the San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH) will be fully refurbushed and modernised by 2025.

He expressed this confidence to the media during a visit to the SFGH on Tuesday.

Deyalsingh reminded the media that a sum of $34 million has been allocated in the public sector investment programme (PSIP) for the current fiscal year to improve the infrastructure and facilities at SFGH, Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex and the Port of Spain General Hospital.

He said additional money will be placed in the PSIP for the next fiscal year to continue those works.

Deyalsingh directed the media's attention to the plethora of scaffolding on site at the SFGH to show that the upgrade of the hospital has already begun.

That work, he continued, included replacing the roof tiles and modernising the wards.

"It (SFGH) is going to be a world class facility in the next two years."

Deyalsingh lamented that all three hospitals had fallen into disrepair over the last few decades.

He reiterated that by 2025, SFGH "is going to be totally refurbished modernised and it will result in a better delivery of health care services."

Deyalsingh identified better environments for patients and higher motivation for staff as two other benefits to come from a modernised SFGH.

Acting South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) CEO Stephen Alleyne elaborated on the work taking place at the hospital.

He said the wards on the 3rd floor of the hospital have been decanted, work has started on that floor and is gradually moving down one floor at a time.

Alleyne said the new hospital will have better labour, antenatal and postnatal wards.

The quality of the SFGH's 700 bed stock will be improved, the entire hospital will be air-conditoned and further expansions will be made to its accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Deyalsingh said this department was already expanded five years ago to treat patients who did not require hospitalisation.

He was confident that the Augustus Long Hospital (ALH) , which was "gifted" by Heritage Petroleum Ltd to SWRHA, will be operationalised as the SFGH's new oncology centre next June-July.

Deyalsingh said the existing oncology facility at SFGH left a lot to be desired for patients and their families.

He added that a palliative care unit will also be established at ALH for cancer patients in end of life stage.

- Jeff K. Mayers

HEALTH Minister Terrence Deyalsingh is confident that the San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH) will be fully refurbushed and modernised by 2025.

He expressed this confidence to the media during a visit to the SFGH on Tuesday.

Deyalsingh reminded the media that a sum of $34 million has been allocated in the public sector investment programme (PSIP) for the current fiscal year to improve the infrastructure and facilities at SFGH, Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex and the Port of Spain General Hospital.

He said additional money will be placed in the PSIP for the next fiscal year to continue those works.

Deyalsingh directed the media's attention to the plethora of scaffolding on site at the SFGH to show that the upgrade of the hospital has already begun.

That work, he continued, included replacing the roof tiles and modernising the wards.

"It (SFGH) is going to be a world class facility in the next two years."

Deyalsingh lamented that all three hospitals had fallen into disrepair over the last few decades.

He reiterated that by 2025, SFGH "is going to be totally refurbished modernised and it will result in a better delivery of health care services."

Deyalsingh identified better environments for patients and higher motivation for staff as two other benefits to come from a modernised SFGH.

Acting South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) CEO Stephen Alleyne elaborated on the work taking place at the hospital.

He said the wards on the 3rd floor of the hospital have been decanted, work has started on that floor and is gradually moving down one floor at a time.

Alleyne said the new hospital will have better labour, antenatal and postnatal wards.

The quality of the SFGH's 700 bed stock will be improved, the entire hospital will be air-conditoned and further expansions will be made to its accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Deyalsingh said this department was already expanded five years ago to treat patients who did not require hospitalisation.

He was confident that the Augustus Long Hospital (ALH) , which was "gifted" by Heritage Petroleum Ltd to SWRHA, will be operationalised as the SFGH's new oncology centre next June-July.

Deyalsingh said the existing oncology facility at SFGH left a lot to be desired for patients and their families.

He added that a palliative care unit will also be established at ALH for cancer patients in end of life stage.

CEBU CITY, Philippines- The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) has recorded 14 firecracker-related injuries from December 21 to December 27, 2023.


According to the data issued by DOH-7, eight cases were reported in Bohol Province, three in Cebu Province, two in Cebu City, and one in Mandaue City.


Dr. Eugenia Mercedes Cañal, the head of the Regional Epidemiologist and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of DOH-7, reported that the youngest victim was nine years old.


She added that the top firecrackers causing injuries were 'lantaka,' goodbye Philippines, and whistle bomb.
 
Other cases involved injuries from kwitis, power bomb, shotgun, and triangle.


'Pinakadaghan nato nga anatomical side nga nabuntahan sa parts of the body is ang atoang kamot. Naa pud tay pipila sa mata, sa ulo diri dapit sa forehead, especially sa mga lantaka kay mobuga man gud sila and pipila sa kamot ug sa around the waist,' Cañal said.


Cañal, however, mentioned that the recorded cases this year were 33 percent lower compared to the 21 cases reported in the same period last year.


The DOH is also hopeful that Central Visayas will be able to record zero firecracker casualties this year. But Cañal acknowledged the possibility of an increase in firecracker-related injuries during the New Year celebration.


'We're not hoping nga ma-zero. Well, tanan man gyud na magpabuto pero we are really aiming to have lower cases,' Cañal said.
 
The agency has not recorded any cases of amputation from the 14 firecracker-related injuries. Furthermore, DOH-7 has not documented any cases of stray bullets.

KUCHING, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Petronas Dagangan Berhad is mobilising additional diesel supplies to Sarawak within two days after supply of the fuel was disrupted at Petronas-owned stations in the state, said Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali. He said Petronas was required to provide a list of petrol stations involved in the delivery of additional supplies.

"This is to enable comprehensive monitoring to be made," he said in a WhatsApp message to Bernama here today.

- Jeff K. Mayers

HEALTH Minister Terrence Deyalsingh is confident that the San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH) will be fully refurbushed and modernised by 2025.

He expressed this confidence to the media during a visit to the SFGH on Tuesday.

Deyalsingh reminded the media that a sum of $34 million has been allocated in the public sector investment programme (PSIP) for the current fiscal year to improve the infrastructure and facilities at SFGH, Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex and the Port of Spain General Hospital.

He said additional money will be placed in the PSIP for the next fiscal year to continue those works.

Deyalsingh directed the media's attention to the plethora of scaffolding on site at the SFGH to show that the upgrade of the hospital has already begun.

That work, he continued, included replacing the roof tiles and modernising the wards.

"It (SFGH) is going to be a world class facility in the next two years."

Deyalsingh lamented that all three hospitals had fallen into disrepair over the last few decades.

He reiterated that by 2025, SFGH "is going to be totally refurbished modernised and it will result in a better delivery of health care services."

Deyalsingh identified better environments for patients and higher motivation for staff as two other benefits to come from a modernised SFGH.

Acting South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) CEO Stephen Alleyne elaborated on the work taking place at the hospital.

He said the wards on the 3rd floor of the hospital have been decanted, work has started on that floor and is gradually moving down one floor at a time.

Alleyne said the new hospital will have better labour, antenatal and postnatal wards.

The quality of the SFGH's 700 bed stock will be improved, the entire hospital will be air-conditoned and further expansions will be made to its accident and emergency (A&E) department.

Deyalsingh said this department was already expanded five years ago to treat patients who did not require hospitalisation.

He was confident that the Augustus Long Hospital (ALH) , which was "gifted" by Heritage Petroleum Ltd to SWRHA, will be operationalised as the SFGH's new oncology centre next June-July.

Deyalsingh said the existing oncology facility at SFGH left a lot to be desired for patients and their families.

He added that a palliative care unit will also be established at ALH for cancer patients in end of life stage.

CEBU CITY, Philippines- The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) has recorded 14 firecracker-related injuries from December 21 to December 27, 2023.


According to the data issued by DOH-7, eight cases were reported in Bohol Province, three in Cebu Province, two in Cebu City, and one in Mandaue City.


Dr. Eugenia Mercedes Cañal, the head of the Regional Epidemiologist and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of DOH-7, reported that the youngest victim was nine years old.


She added that the top firecrackers causing injuries were 'lantaka,' goodbye Philippines, and whistle bomb.
 
Other cases involved injuries from kwitis, power bomb, shotgun, and triangle.


'Pinakadaghan nato nga anatomical side nga nabuntahan sa parts of the body is ang atoang kamot. Naa pud tay pipila sa mata, sa ulo diri dapit sa forehead, especially sa mga lantaka kay mobuga man gud sila and pipila sa kamot ug sa around the waist,' Cañal said.


Cañal, however, mentioned that the recorded cases this year were 33 percent lower compared to the 21 cases reported in the same period last year.


The DOH is also hopeful that Central Visayas will be able to record zero firecracker casualties this year. But Cañal acknowledged the possibility of an increase in firecracker-related injuries during the New Year celebration.


'We're not hoping nga ma-zero. Well, tanan man gyud na magpabuto pero we are really aiming to have lower cases,' Cañal said.
 
The agency has not recorded any cases of amputation from the 14 firecracker-related injuries. Furthermore, DOH-7 has not documented any cases of stray bullets.

KUCHING, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Petronas Dagangan Berhad is mobilising additional diesel supplies to Sarawak within two days after supply of the fuel was disrupted at Petronas-owned stations in the state, said Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali.

CEBU CITY, Philippines- The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) has recorded 14 firecracker-related injuries from December 21 to December 27, 2023.


According to the data issued by DOH-7, eight cases were reported in Bohol Province, three in Cebu Province, two in Cebu City, and one in Mandaue City.


Dr. Eugenia Mercedes Cañal, the head of the Regional Epidemiologist and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of DOH-7, reported that the youngest victim was nine years old.


She added that the top firecrackers causing injuries were 'lantaka,' goodbye Philippines, and whistle bomb.
 
Other cases involved injuries from kwitis, power bomb, shotgun, and triangle.


'Pinakadaghan nato nga anatomical side nga nabuntahan sa parts of the body is ang atoang kamot. Naa pud tay pipila sa mata, sa ulo diri dapit sa forehead, especially sa mga lantaka kay mobuga man gud sila and pipila sa kamot ug sa around the waist,' Cañal said.


Cañal, however, mentioned that the recorded cases this year were 33 percent lower compared to the 21 cases reported in the same period last year.


The DOH is also hopeful that Central Visayas will be able to record zero firecracker casualties this year. But Cañal acknowledged the possibility of an increase in firecracker-related injuries during the New Year celebration.


'We're not hoping nga ma-zero. Well, tanan man gyud na magpabuto pero we are really aiming to have lower cases,' Cañal said.
 
The agency has not recorded any cases of amputation from the 14 firecracker-related injuries. Furthermore, DOH-7 has not documented any cases of stray bullets.

KUCHING, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Petronas Dagangan Berhad is mobilising additional diesel supplies to Sarawak within two days after supply of the fuel was disrupted at Petronas-owned stations in the state, said Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali. He said Petronas was required to provide a list of petrol stations involved in the delivery of additional supplies.

"This is to enable comprehensive monitoring to be made," he said in a WhatsApp message to Bernama here today.

CEBU CITY, Philippines- The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) has recorded 14 firecracker-related injuries from December 21 to December 27, 2023.


According to the data issued by DOH-7, eight cases were reported in Bohol Province, three in Cebu Province, two in Cebu City, and one in Mandaue City.


Dr. Eugenia Mercedes Cañal, the head of the Regional Epidemiologist and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of DOH-7, reported that the youngest victim was nine years old.


She added that the top firecrackers causing injuries were 'lantaka,' goodbye Philippines, and whistle bomb.
 
Other cases involved injuries from kwitis, power bomb, shotgun, and triangle.


'Pinakadaghan nato nga anatomical side nga nabuntahan sa parts of the body is ang atoang kamot. Naa pud tay pipila sa mata, sa ulo diri dapit sa forehead, especially sa mga lantaka kay mobuga man gud sila and pipila sa kamot ug sa around the waist,' Cañal said.


Cañal, however, mentioned that the recorded cases this year were 33 percent lower compared to the 21 cases reported in the same period last year.


The DOH is also hopeful that Central Visayas will be able to record zero firecracker casualties this year. But Cañal acknowledged the possibility of an increase in firecracker-related injuries during the New Year celebration.


'We're not hoping nga ma-zero. Well, tanan man gyud na magpabuto pero we are really aiming to have lower cases,' Cañal said.
 
The agency has not recorded any cases of amputation from the 14 firecracker-related injuries. Furthermore, DOH-7 has not documented any cases of stray bullets.

KUCHING, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Petronas Dagangan Berhad is mobilising additional diesel supplies to Sarawak within two days after supply of the fuel was disrupted at Petronas-owned stations in the state, said Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali. He said Petronas was required to provide a list of petrol stations involved in the delivery of additional supplies.

"This is to enable comprehensive monitoring to be made," he said in a WhatsApp message to Bernama here today.

KUCHING, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Petronas Dagangan Berhad is mobilising additional diesel supplies to Sarawak within two days after supply of the fuel was disrupted at Petronas-owned stations in the state, said Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali. He said Petronas was required to provide a list of petrol stations involved in the delivery of additional supplies.

"This is to enable comprehensive monitoring to be made," he said in a WhatsApp message to Bernama here today.

CEBU CITY, Philippines- The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) has recorded 14 firecracker-related injuries from December 21 to December 27, 2023.


According to the data issued by DOH-7, eight cases were reported in Bohol Province, three in Cebu Province, two in Cebu City, and one in Mandaue City.


Dr. Eugenia Mercedes Cañal, the head of the Regional Epidemiologist and Surveillance Unit (RESU) of DOH-7, reported that the youngest victim was nine years old.


She added that the top firecrackers causing injuries were 'lantaka,' goodbye Philippines, and whistle bomb.
 
Other cases involved injuries from kwitis, power bomb, shotgun, and triangle.


'Pinakadaghan nato nga anatomical side nga nabuntahan sa parts of the body is ang atoang kamot. Naa pud tay pipila sa mata, sa ulo diri dapit sa forehead, especially sa mga lantaka kay mobuga man gud sila and pipila sa kamot ug sa around the waist,' Cañal said.


Cañal, however, mentioned that the recorded cases this year were 33 percent lower compared to the 21 cases reported in the same period last year.


The DOH is also hopeful that Central Visayas will be able to record zero firecracker casualties this year. But Cañal acknowledged the possibility of an increase in firecracker-related injuries during the New Year celebration.


'We're not hoping nga ma-zero. Well, tanan man gyud na magpabuto pero we are really aiming to have lower cases,' Cañal said.
 
The agency has not recorded any cases of amputation from the 14 firecracker-related injuries. Furthermore, DOH-7 has not documented any cases of stray bullets.

Disney has filed a lawsuit claiming that the oversight government for Walt Disney World, which was taken over by appointees of Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year, has failed to release documents and properly preserve records in violation of Florida public records law.

Disney said in the lawsuit filed Friday that the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, often referred to as CFTOD, has been so slow in fulfilling its public records duties that it has failed to respond completely to a request the company made seven months ago when it paid more than $2,400 to get emails and text messages belonging to the five district board members appointed by DeSantis.

Disney, DeSantis and the DeSantis appointees already are battling for control of the government in two pending lawsuits in federal and state court.

The public records lawsuit is asking a judge to review any documents that the district claims are exempt from being released, declare that the district is violating state public records law and order the district to release the documents that Disney has requested.

'CFTOD has prevented Disney from discovering the actions of its government through public records requests, in violation of Florida law,' said the lawsuit filed in state court in Orlando. 'The Court should grant Disney relief.'

An email was sent to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District seeking comment.

The new lawsuit claims that the district is failing to follow public records laws in other ways, such as allowing the DeSantis-appointed board members to use personal email addresses and texts for district business without a process for making sure they are preserved and failing to make sure board members don't auto-delete messages dealing with district business.

The feud between DeSantis and Disney started last year after the company publicly opposed the state's so-called don't say gay law, which bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. In retaliation, DeSantis and Republican legislators took over the district Disney had controlled for more than five decades and installed five board members loyal to the governor.

The Agro MADANI Sales programme is a rebranding of the direct sales from the farm (JTDL) programme organised by the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA) in collaboration with agencies under KPKM, namely the Farmers' Organisation Authority (LPP) and the Malaysian Fisheries Development Board (LKIM).
 
The initiative aims to help people across the country get supplies of fresh products easily, at reasonable prices and with savings of 10 per cent to 30 per cent compared to local market prices.

The Denver Police Department declined in an email to provide details about its investigations, citing safety and privacy considerations and because they are ongoing.
 
The department 'is currently investigating incidents directed at Colorado Supreme Court justices and will continue working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to thoroughly investigate any reports of threats or harassment,' the email said.
 
Officers responded to the home of one justice on Thursday evening, but police said it appeared to be a 'hoax report.' That case is also still being investigated police said.
 
The FBI said it is working with local law enforcement on the matter. 
 
'We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions regardless of motivation,' a spokesperson for the Denver's FBI office, Vikki Migoya, said in a statement. 
 
In a 4-3 decision last week, Colorado's highest court overturned a ruling from a district court judge who found that Trump incited an insurrection for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but had said he could not be barred from the ballot because it was unclear that U.S. Constitution's insurrection clause was intended to cover the presidency.
 
The state's highest court didn't agree, siding with attorneys for six Colorado Republican and unaffiliated voters who argued that it was nonsensical to imagine that the framers of the amendment, fearful of former confederates returning to power, would bar them from low-level offices but not the highest one in the land.
 
The court stayed its decision until Jan. 4, or until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the case. Colorado officials say the issue must be settled by Jan. 5, the deadline for the state to print its presidential primary ballots.

The new lawsuit claims that the district is failing to follow public records laws in other ways, such as allowing the DeSantis-appointed board members to use personal email addresses and texts for district business without a process for making sure they are preserved and failing to make sure board members don't auto-delete messages dealing with district business.

The feud between DeSantis and Disney started last year after the company publicly opposed the state's so-called don't say gay law, which bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. In retaliation, DeSantis and Republican legislators took over the district Disney had controlled for more than five decades and installed five board members loyal to the governor.

Around 50 out of about 370 employees have left the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District since it was taken over in February, raising concerns that decades of institutional knowledge are dep, media=https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/MILW_weblogo.png, _id=a0e1740fa498693f6d1d3c294a3a2daf}, {wishlistId=228, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=AGRO MADANI SALES: NUMBER OF LOCATIONS, SALES VALUE EXCEED TARGET, author=BERNAMA, link=https://www.bernama.com/en/general/news.php?id=2257629, summary=PUTRAJAYA, Dec  27 (Bernama) --The government has held the Agro MADANI Sale programme at 5,573  locations nationwide, recording a total sales value of RM92.76 million as of Dec 24, exceeding the target of 5,000 locations and RM39 million in sales, according to the  Agriculture and Food Security Ministry (KPKM).

The Denver Police Department declined in an email to provide details about its investigations, citing safety and privacy considerations and because they are ongoing.
 
The department 'is currently investigating incidents directed at Colorado Supreme Court justices and will continue working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to thoroughly investigate any reports of threats or harassment,' the email said.
 
Officers responded to the home of one justice on Thursday evening, but police said it appeared to be a 'hoax report.' That case is also still being investigated police said.
 
The FBI said it is working with local law enforcement on the matter. 
 
'We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions regardless of motivation,' a spokesperson for the Denver's FBI office, Vikki Migoya, said in a statement. 
 
In a 4-3 decision last week, Colorado's highest court overturned a ruling from a district court judge who found that Trump incited an insurrection for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but had said he could not be barred from the ballot because it was unclear that U.S. Constitution's insurrection clause was intended to cover the presidency.
 
The state's highest court didn't agree, siding with attorneys for six Colorado Republican and unaffiliated voters who argued that it was nonsensical to imagine that the framers of the amendment, fearful of former confederates returning to power, would bar them from low-level offices but not the highest one in the land.
 
The court stayed its decision until Jan. 4, or until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the case. Colorado officials say the issue must be settled by Jan. 5, the deadline for the state to print its presidential primary ballots.

The Denver Police Department declined in an email to provide details about its investigations, citing safety and privacy considerations and because they are ongoing.
 
The department 'is currently investigating incidents directed at Colorado Supreme Court justices and will continue working with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to thoroughly investigate any reports of threats or harassment,' the email said.
 
Officers responded to the home of one justice on Thursday evening, but police said it appeared to be a 'hoax report.' That case is also still being investigated police said.
 
The FBI said it is working with local law enforcement on the matter. 
 
'We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions regardless of motivation,' a spokesperson for the Denver's FBI office, Vikki Migoya, said in a statement. 
 
In a 4-3 decision last week, Colorado's highest court overturned a ruling from a district court judge who found that Trump incited an insurrection for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but had said he could not be barred from the ballot because it was unclear that U.S. Constitution's insurrection clause was intended to cover the presidency.
 
The state's highest court didn't agree, siding with attorneys for six Colorado Republican and unaffiliated voters who argued that it was nonsensical to imagine that the framers of the amendment, fearful of former confederates returning to power, would bar them from low-level offices but not the highest one in the land.
 
The court stayed its decision until Jan. 4, or until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the case. Colorado officials say the issue must be settled by Jan. 5, the deadline for the state to print its presidential primary ballots.

The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement on Wednesday, opening a new front in the increasingly intense legal battle over the unauthorized use of published work to train artificial intelligence technologies.

The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.

The suit does not include an exact monetary demand. But it says the defendants should be held responsible for 'billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages' related to the 'unlawful copying and use of The Times's uniquely valuable works.' It also calls for the companies to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use copyrighted material from The Times., media=https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/editorandpublisher/medium/20231227-103332-NY%20Times%20Bldg.png.jpg, _id=58110a745a2d1b5c0ec530827b2c0f61}, {wishlistId=240, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Vanderpump Rules: Ariana Madix Gets REVENGE In $2 Million Payday!, author=Joanne Eglash, link=https://celebratingthesoaps.com/reality-tv/vanderpump-rules-ariana-madix-gets-revenge-in-2-million-payday/, summary=Vanderpump Rules

Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – Show Soars, Ariana Scores!
How does a reality TV show go from sinking ratings to soaring viewer numbers, complete with an Emmy nomination? For Vanderpump Rules, the secret to the turnaround came in Tom Sandoval cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with Ariana's own best friend and co-star Raquel Leviss. And '
Scandoval
' also gave Madix enough publicity to score a fortune as well as fame, per 
Page Six
.
But while Ariana could have sulked over Sandoval cheating, the Vanderpump Rules star triumphed. And she inked deals for new TV roles, brand partnerships, and even a Broadway role. (Somewhere in California, 
fame-hungry Meghan Markle
 just turned green with envy).
However, Madix doesn't just wave around a bag of Lay's potato chips in exchange for those brand partnerships. And an expert noted that the Vanderpump Rules star brings 
'something else to the table other than just, ‘Hey, hold a bag of chips.' There's a story she can tell,'
 added Amy Luca, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Social at Media Monks.
And Luca noted that Ariana gets 
'highly involved in the creative of whatever those partnerships are, which is really wonderful for brands and agencies. We love when we get some 
creative partnership. And she's an entrepreneur at heart.'
Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – No
 ‘Generational Wealth'
And Ariana stayed honest about her goal. Because her family lacks any
 'generational wealth,'
 she wants 
'to make enough money to be able to take care of my mom and my brother and any other family members who may or may not need it.'
As a result, the Vanderpump Rules star has vowed to
 'work as much as possible.' And after 'Scandoval
' made headlines in March 2023, Ariana used her time wisely. By June, she had signed partnerships with 10 brands. For instance, the Vanderpump Rules star chose
 Uber One, Bic Razors, Lay's, Glad and Duracell, and Bellesa sex toys for her deals.
 
And Ariana didn't hesitate to mock her cheating ex boyfriend in her social media endorsements for these brands. For example, media=https://cts-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/26113856/Ariana-Madix-3.jpg, _id=885dcbd86bfb97ca15ad04d2d09a81b6}, {wishlistId=241, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Commentary: 11 More Examples of Defensive Gun Use to Fend Off Criminals, author=Georgia Star News Staff, link=https://georgiastarnews.com/commentary/commentary-11-more-examples-of-defensive-gun-use-to-fend-off-criminals/GAStarNewsStaff/2023/12/27/, summary=As cities across the country reel from explosive crime rates, many politicians at the local, state, and federal levels are too preoccupied with disarming peaceable American gun owners to identify, arrest, and prosecute actual criminals adequately.


Two masked attackers met their match last month when they attacked Los Angeles resident Vince Ricci as he walked toward the front door of his house. The pair brandished a firearm at Ricci, who pulled out his own gun and shot at the thugs, who ran away.


Ricci successfully defended not only himself but his wife and baby daughter, who were inside.


Like millions of other Americans, Ricci is a law-abiding gun owner who carries a firearm for protection.


Well, he used to be.


After the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department suspended Ricci's concealed carry permit for reasons that are still unclear. His attackers were still at large, and he said he worries that his family will '
become a statistic
' because of this unfair treatment as a crime victim.


Despite repeated attempts by gun control advocates to downplay the importance of armed self-defense, successful defensive gun uses such as Ricci's actions are far from a rare occurrence. Almost every major study has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between 
500,000 and 3 million times
 annually, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged. In 2021, the most comprehensive study ever conducted on the issue concluded that 
roughly 1.6 million defensive gun uses
 occur in the United States every year.

The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement on Wednesday, opening a new front in the increasingly intense legal battle over the unauthorized use of published work to train artificial intelligence technologies.

The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.

The suit does not include an exact monetary demand. But it says the defendants should be held responsible for 'billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages' related to the 'unlawful copying and use of The Times's uniquely valuable works.' It also calls for the companies to destroy any chatbot models and training data that use copyrighted material from The Times., media=https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/editorandpublisher/medium/20231227-103332-NY%20Times%20Bldg.png.jpg, _id=58110a745a2d1b5c0ec530827b2c0f61}, {wishlistId=240, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Vanderpump Rules: Ariana Madix Gets REVENGE In $2 Million Payday!, author=Joanne Eglash, link=https://celebratingthesoaps.com/reality-tv/vanderpump-rules-ariana-madix-gets-revenge-in-2-million-payday/, summary=Vanderpump Rules

Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – Show Soars, Ariana Scores!
How does a reality TV show go from sinking ratings to soaring viewer numbers, complete with an Emmy nomination? For Vanderpump Rules, the secret to the turnaround came in Tom Sandoval cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with Ariana's own best friend and co-star Raquel Leviss. And '
Scandoval
' also gave Madix enough publicity to score a fortune as well as fame, per 
Page Six
.
But while Ariana could have sulked over Sandoval cheating, the Vanderpump Rules star triumphed. And she inked deals for new TV roles, brand partnerships, and even a Broadway role. (Somewhere in California, 
fame-hungry Meghan Markle
 just turned green with envy).
However, Madix doesn't just wave around a bag of Lay's potato chips in exchange for those brand partnerships. And an expert noted that the Vanderpump Rules star brings 
'something else to the table other than just, ‘Hey, hold a bag of chips.' There's a story she can tell,'
 added Amy Luca, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Social at Media Monks.
And Luca noted that Ariana gets 
'highly involved in the creative of whatever those partnerships are, which is really wonderful for brands and agencies. We love when we get some 
creative partnership. And she's an entrepreneur at heart.'
Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – No
 ‘Generational Wealth'
And Ariana stayed honest about her goal. Because her family lacks any
 'generational wealth,'
 she wants 
'to make enough money to be able to take care of my mom and my brother and any other family members who may or may not need it.'
As a result, the Vanderpump Rules star has vowed to
 'work as much as possible.' And after 'Scandoval
' made headlines in March 2023, Ariana used her time wisely. By June, she had signed partnerships with 10 brands. For instance, the Vanderpump Rules star chose
 Uber One, Bic Razors, Lay's, Glad and Duracell, and Bellesa sex toys for her deals.
 
And Ariana didn't hesitate to mock her cheating ex boyfriend in her social media endorsements for these brands. For example, media=https://cts-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/26113856/Ariana-Madix-3.jpg, _id=885dcbd86bfb97ca15ad04d2d09a81b6}, {wishlistId=241, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Commentary: 11 More Examples of Defensive Gun Use to Fend Off Criminals, author=Georgia Star News Staff, link=https://georgiastarnews.com/commentary/commentary-11-more-examples-of-defensive-gun-use-to-fend-off-criminals/GAStarNewsStaff/2023/12/27/, summary=As cities across the country reel from explosive crime rates, many politicians at the local, state, and federal levels are too preoccupied with disarming peaceable American gun owners to identify, arrest, and prosecute actual criminals adequately.


Two masked attackers met their match last month when they attacked Los Angeles resident Vince Ricci as he walked toward the front door of his house. The pair brandished a firearm at Ricci, who pulled out his own gun and shot at the thugs, who ran away.


Ricci successfully defended not only himself but his wife and baby daughter, who were inside.


Like millions of other Americans, Ricci is a law-abiding gun owner who carries a firearm for protection.


Well, he used to be.


After the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department suspended Ricci's concealed carry permit for reasons that are still unclear. His attackers were still at large, and he said he worries that his family will '
become a statistic
' because of this unfair treatment as a crime victim.


Despite repeated attempts by gun control advocates to downplay the importance of armed self-defense, successful defensive gun uses such as Ricci's actions are far from a rare occurrence. Almost every major study has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between 
500,000 and 3 million times
 annually, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged. In 2021, the most comprehensive study ever conducted on the issue concluded that 
roughly 1.6 million defensive gun uses
 occur in the United States every year.

The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement on Wednesday, opening a new front in the increasingly intense legal battle over the unauthorized use of published work to train artificial intelligence technologies.

The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.

The suit does not include an exact monetary demand. But it says the defendants should be held responsible for 'billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages' related to the 'unlawful copying and use of The Times's uniquely valuable works.'

Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – Show Soars, Ariana Scores!
How does a reality TV show go from sinking ratings to soaring viewer numbers, complete with an Emmy nomination? For Vanderpump Rules, the secret to the turnaround came in Tom Sandoval cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with Ariana's own best friend and co-star Raquel Leviss. And '
Scandoval
' also gave Madix enough publicity to score a fortune as well as fame, per 
Page Six
.
But while Ariana could have sulked over Sandoval cheating, the Vanderpump Rules star triumphed. And she inked deals for new TV roles, brand partnerships, and even a Broadway role. (Somewhere in California, 
fame-hungry Meghan Markle
 just turned green with envy).
However, Madix doesn't just wave around a bag of Lay's potato chips in exchange for those brand partnerships. And an expert noted that the Vanderpump Rules star brings 
'something else to the table other than just, ‘Hey, hold a bag of chips.' There's a story she can tell,'
 added Amy Luca, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Social at Media Monks.
And Luca noted that Ariana gets 
'highly involved in the creative of whatever those partnerships are, which is really wonderful for brands and agencies. We love when we get some 
creative partnership. And she's an entrepreneur at heart.'
Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – No
 ‘Generational Wealth'
And Ariana stayed honest about her goal. Because her family lacks any
 'generational wealth,'
 she wants 
'to make enough money to be able to take care of my mom and my brother and any other family members who may or may not need it.'
As a result, the Vanderpump Rules star has vowed to
 'work as much as possible.' And after 'Scandoval
' made headlines in March 2023, Ariana used her time wisely. By June, she had signed partnerships with 10 brands. For instance, the Vanderpump Rules star chose
 Uber One, Bic Razors, Lay's, Glad and Duracell, and Bellesa sex toys for her deals.
 
And Ariana didn't hesitate to mock her cheating ex boyfriend in her social media endorsements for these brands. For example, media=https://cts-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/26113856/Ariana-Madix-3.jpg, _id=885dcbd86bfb97ca15ad04d2d09a81b6}, {wishlistId=241, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Commentary: 11 More Examples of Defensive Gun Use to Fend Off Criminals, author=Georgia Star News Staff, link=https://georgiastarnews.com/commentary/commentary-11-more-examples-of-defensive-gun-use-to-fend-off-criminals/GAStarNewsStaff/2023/12/27/, summary=As cities across the country reel from explosive crime rates, many politicians at the local, state, and federal levels are too preoccupied with disarming peaceable American gun owners to identify, arrest, and prosecute actual criminals adequately.


Two masked attackers met their match last month when they attacked Los Angeles resident Vince Ricci as he walked toward the front door of his house. The pair brandished a firearm at Ricci, who pulled out his own gun and shot at the thugs, who ran away.


Ricci successfully defended not only himself but his wife and baby daughter, who were inside.


Like millions of other Americans, Ricci is a law-abiding gun owner who carries a firearm for protection.


Well, he used to be.


After the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department suspended Ricci's concealed carry permit for reasons that are still unclear. His attackers were still at large, and he said he worries that his family will '
become a statistic
' because of this unfair treatment as a crime victim.


Despite repeated attempts by gun control advocates to downplay the importance of armed self-defense, successful defensive gun uses such as Ricci's actions are far from a rare occurrence. Almost every major study has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between 
500,000 and 3 million times
 annually, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged. In 2021, the most comprehensive study ever conducted on the issue concluded that 
roughly 1.6 million defensive gun uses
 occur in the United States every year.

It's supposed to warm up ahead of the storm with a high temperature near 58 degrees and the wind out of the south at 5-10 mph increasing to 15-20 mph before lunch time. Gusts could hit 35 mph.

It's supposed to warm up ahead of the storm with a high temperature near 58 degrees and the wind out of the south at 5-10 mph increasing to 15-20 mph before lunch time. Gusts could hit 35 mph.

The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement on Wednesday, opening a new front in the increasingly intense legal battle over the unauthorized use of published work to train artificial intelligence technologies.

The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.

The suit does not include an exact monetary demand.

Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – Show Soars, Ariana Scores!
How does a reality TV show go from sinking ratings to soaring viewer numbers, complete with an Emmy nomination? For Vanderpump Rules, the secret to the turnaround came in Tom Sandoval cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with Ariana's own best friend and co-star Raquel Leviss. And '
Scandoval
' also gave Madix enough publicity to score a fortune as well as fame, per 
Page Six
.
But while Ariana could have sulked over Sandoval cheating, the Vanderpump Rules star triumphed. And she inked deals for new TV roles, brand partnerships, and even a Broadway role. (Somewhere in California, 
fame-hungry Meghan Markle
 just turned green with envy).
However, Madix doesn't just wave around a bag of Lay's potato chips in exchange for those brand partnerships. And an expert noted that the Vanderpump Rules star brings 
'something else to the table other than just, ‘Hey, hold a bag of chips.' There's a story she can tell,'
 added Amy Luca, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Social at Media Monks.
And Luca noted that Ariana gets 
'highly involved in the creative of whatever those partnerships are, which is really wonderful for brands and agencies. We love when we get some 
creative partnership. And she's an entrepreneur at heart.'
Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – No
 ‘Generational Wealth'
And Ariana stayed honest about her goal. Because her family lacks any
 'generational wealth,'
 she wants 
'to make enough money to be able to take care of my mom and my brother and any other family members who may or may not need it.'
As a result, the Vanderpump Rules star has vowed to
 'work as much as possible.' And after 'Scandoval
' made headlines in March 2023, Ariana used her time wisely. By June, she had signed partnerships with 10 brands. For instance, the Vanderpump Rules star chose
 Uber One, Bic Razors, Lay's, Glad and Duracell, and Bellesa sex toys for her deals.
 
And Ariana didn't hesitate to mock her cheating ex boyfriend in her social media endorsements for these brands. For example, media=https://cts-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/26113856/Ariana-Madix-3.jpg, _id=885dcbd86bfb97ca15ad04d2d09a81b6}, {wishlistId=241, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Commentary: 11 More Examples of Defensive Gun Use to Fend Off Criminals, author=Georgia Star News Staff, link=https://georgiastarnews.com/commentary/commentary-11-more-examples-of-defensive-gun-use-to-fend-off-criminals/GAStarNewsStaff/2023/12/27/, summary=As cities across the country reel from explosive crime rates, many politicians at the local, state, and federal levels are too preoccupied with disarming peaceable American gun owners to identify, arrest, and prosecute actual criminals adequately.


Two masked attackers met their match last month when they attacked Los Angeles resident Vince Ricci as he walked toward the front door of his house. The pair brandished a firearm at Ricci, who pulled out his own gun and shot at the thugs, who ran away.


Ricci successfully defended not only himself but his wife and baby daughter, who were inside.


Like millions of other Americans, Ricci is a law-abiding gun owner who carries a firearm for protection.


Well, he used to be.


After the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department suspended Ricci's concealed carry permit for reasons that are still unclear. His attackers were still at large, and he said he worries that his family will '
become a statistic
' because of this unfair treatment as a crime victim.


Despite repeated attempts by gun control advocates to downplay the importance of armed self-defense, successful defensive gun uses such as Ricci's actions are far from a rare occurrence. Almost every major study has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between 
500,000 and 3 million times
 annually, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged. In 2021, the most comprehensive study ever conducted on the issue concluded that 
roughly 1.6 million defensive gun uses
 occur in the United States every year.

Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – Show Soars, Ariana Scores!
How does a reality TV show go from sinking ratings to soaring viewer numbers, complete with an Emmy nomination? For Vanderpump Rules, the secret to the turnaround came in Tom Sandoval cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with Ariana's own best friend and co-star Raquel Leviss. And '
Scandoval
' also gave Madix enough publicity to score a fortune as well as fame, per 
Page Six
.
But while Ariana could have sulked over Sandoval cheating, the Vanderpump Rules star triumphed. And she inked deals for new TV roles, brand partnerships, and even a Broadway role. (Somewhere in California, 
fame-hungry Meghan Markle
 just turned green with envy).
However, Madix doesn't just wave around a bag of Lay's potato chips in exchange for those brand partnerships. And an expert noted that the Vanderpump Rules star brings 
'something else to the table other than just, ‘Hey, hold a bag of chips.' There's a story she can tell,'
 added Amy Luca, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Social at Media Monks.
And Luca noted that Ariana gets 
'highly involved in the creative of whatever those partnerships are, which is really wonderful for brands and agencies. We love when we get some 
creative partnership. And she's an entrepreneur at heart.'

 ‘Generational Wealth'
And Ariana stayed honest about her goal. Because her family lacks any
 'generational wealth,'
 she wants 
'to make enough money to be able to take care of my mom and my brother and any other family members who may or may not need it.'
As a result, the Vanderpump Rules star has vowed to
 'work as much as possible.' And after 'Scandoval
' made headlines in March 2023, Ariana used her time wisely. By June, she had signed partnerships with 10 brands. For instance, the Vanderpump Rules star chose
 Uber One, Bic Razors, Lay's, Glad and Duracell, and Bellesa sex toys for her deals.
 
And Ariana didn't hesitate to mock her cheating ex boyfriend in her social media endorsements for these brands.

Two masked attackers met their match last month when they attacked Los Angeles resident Vince Ricci as he walked toward the front door of his house. The pair brandished a firearm at Ricci, who pulled out his own gun and shot at the thugs, who ran away.


Ricci successfully defended not only himself but his wife and baby daughter, who were inside.


Like millions of other Americans, Ricci is a law-abiding gun owner who carries a firearm for protection.


Well, he used to be.


After the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department suspended Ricci's concealed carry permit for reasons that are still unclear. His attackers were still at large, and he said he worries that his family will '
become a statistic
' because of this unfair treatment as a crime victim.


Despite repeated attempts by gun control advocates to downplay the importance of armed self-defense, successful defensive gun uses such as Ricci's actions are far from a rare occurrence. Almost every major study has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between 
500,000 and 3 million times
 annually, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged. In 2021, the most comprehensive study ever conducted on the issue concluded that 
roughly 1.6 million defensive gun uses
 occur in the United States every year.


For this reason, 
The Daily Signal
 publishes a monthly article highlighting some of the previous month's many news stories on defensive gun use that you may have missed—or that might not have made it to the national spotlight in the first place. (

 from past months and years. You also may follow

Two masked attackers met their match last month when they attacked Los Angeles resident Vince Ricci as he walked toward the front door of his house. The pair brandished a firearm at Ricci, who pulled out his own gun and shot at the thugs, who ran away.


Ricci successfully defended not only himself but his wife and baby daughter, who were inside.


Like millions of other Americans, Ricci is a law-abiding gun owner who carries a firearm for protection.


Well, he used to be.


After the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department suspended Ricci's concealed carry permit for reasons that are still unclear. His attackers were still at large, and he said he worries that his family will '
become a statistic
' because of this unfair treatment as a crime victim.


Despite repeated attempts by gun control advocates to downplay the importance of armed self-defense, successful defensive gun uses such as Ricci's actions are far from a rare occurrence. Almost every major study has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between 
500,000 and 3 million times
 annually, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged. In 2021, the most comprehensive study ever conducted on the issue concluded that 
roughly 1.6 million defensive gun uses
 occur in the United States every year.

The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement on Wednesday, opening a new front in the increasingly intense legal battle over the unauthorized use of published work to train artificial intelligence technologies.

The Times is the first major American media organization to sue the companies, the creators of ChatGPT and other popular A.I. platforms, over copyright issues associated with its written works. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contends that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information.

The suit does not include an exact monetary demand. But it says the defendants should be held responsible for 'billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages' related to the 'unlawful copying and use of The Times's uniquely valuable works.'

Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – Show Soars, Ariana Scores!
How does a reality TV show go from sinking ratings to soaring viewer numbers, complete with an Emmy nomination? For Vanderpump Rules, the secret to the turnaround came in Tom Sandoval cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with Ariana's own best friend and co-star Raquel Leviss. And '
Scandoval
' also gave Madix enough publicity to score a fortune as well as fame, per 
Page Six
.
But while Ariana could have sulked over Sandoval cheating, the Vanderpump Rules star triumphed. And she inked deals for new TV roles, brand partnerships, and even a Broadway role. (Somewhere in California, 
fame-hungry Meghan Markle
 just turned green with envy).
However, Madix doesn't just wave around a bag of Lay's potato chips in exchange for those brand partnerships. And an expert noted that the Vanderpump Rules star brings 
'something else to the table other than just, ‘Hey, hold a bag of chips.' There's a story she can tell,'
 added Amy Luca, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Social at Media Monks.
And Luca noted that Ariana gets 
'highly involved in the creative of whatever those partnerships are, which is really wonderful for brands and agencies. We love when we get some 
creative partnership. And she's an entrepreneur at heart.'
Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – No
 ‘Generational Wealth'
And Ariana stayed honest about her goal. Because her family lacks any
 'generational wealth,'
 she wants 
'to make enough money to be able to take care of my mom and my brother and any other family members who may or may not need it.'
As a result, the Vanderpump Rules star has vowed to
 'work as much as possible.' And after 'Scandoval
' made headlines in March 2023, Ariana used her time wisely. By June, she had signed partnerships with 10 brands. For instance, the Vanderpump Rules star chose
 Uber One, Bic Razors, Lay's, Glad and Duracell, and Bellesa sex toys for her deals.
 
And Ariana didn't hesitate to mock her cheating ex boyfriend in her social media endorsements for these brands.

Scandoval
' also gave Madix enough publicity to score a fortune as well as fame, per 
Page Six
.
But while Ariana could have sulked over Sandoval cheating, the Vanderpump Rules star triumphed. And she inked deals for new TV roles, brand partnerships, and even a Broadway role. (Somewhere in California, 
fame-hungry Meghan Markle
 just turned green with envy).
However, Madix doesn't just wave around a bag of Lay's potato chips in exchange for those brand partnerships. And an expert noted that the Vanderpump Rules star brings 
'something else to the table other than just, ‘Hey, hold a bag of chips.' There's a story she can tell,'
 added Amy Luca, Executive Vice President, Global Head of Social at Media Monks.
And Luca noted that Ariana gets 
'highly involved in the creative of whatever those partnerships are, which is really wonderful for brands and agencies. We love when we get some 
creative partnership. And she's an entrepreneur at heart.'
Vanderpump Rules Spoilers – No
 ‘Generational Wealth'
And Ariana stayed honest about her goal. Because her family lacks any
 'generational wealth,'
 she wants 
'to make enough money to be able to take care of my mom and my brother and any other family members who may or may not need it.'
As a result, the Vanderpump Rules star has vowed to
 'work as much as possible.' And after 'Scandoval
' made headlines in March 2023, Ariana used her time wisely. By June, she had signed partnerships with 10 brands. For instance, the Vanderpump Rules star chose
 Uber One, Bic Razors, Lay's, Glad and Duracell, and Bellesa sex toys for her deals.
 
And Ariana didn't hesitate to mock her cheating ex boyfriend in her social media endorsements for these brands. For example, media=https://cts-assets.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/26113856/Ariana-Madix-3.jpg, _id=885dcbd86bfb97ca15ad04d2d09a81b6}, {wishlistId=241, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Commentary: 11 More Examples of Defensive Gun Use to Fend Off Criminals, author=Georgia Star News Staff, link=https://georgiastarnews.com/commentary/commentary-11-more-examples-of-defensive-gun-use-to-fend-off-criminals/GAStarNewsStaff/2023/12/27/, summary=As cities across the country reel from explosive crime rates, many politicians at the local, state, and federal levels are too preoccupied with disarming peaceable American gun owners to identify, arrest, and prosecute actual criminals adequately.


Two masked attackers met their match last month when they attacked Los Angeles resident Vince Ricci as he walked toward the front door of his house. The pair brandished a firearm at Ricci, who pulled out his own gun and shot at the thugs, who ran away.


Ricci successfully defended not only himself but his wife and baby daughter, who were inside.


Like millions of other Americans, Ricci is a law-abiding gun owner who carries a firearm for protection.


Well, he used to be.


After the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department suspended Ricci's concealed carry permit for reasons that are still unclear. His attackers were still at large, and he said he worries that his family will '
become a statistic
' because of this unfair treatment as a crime victim.


Despite repeated attempts by gun control advocates to downplay the importance of armed self-defense, successful defensive gun uses such as Ricci's actions are far from a rare occurrence. Almost every major study has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between 
500,000 and 3 million times
 annually, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged. In 2021, the most comprehensive study ever conducted on the issue concluded that 
roughly 1.6 million defensive gun uses
 occur in the United States every year.


For this reason, 
The Daily Signal
 publishes a monthly article highlighting some of the previous month's many news stories on defensive gun use that you may have missed—or that might not have made it to the national spotlight in the first place. (

 'generational wealth,'
 she wants 
'to make enough money to be able to take care of my mom and my brother and any other family members who may or may not need it.'
As a result, the Vanderpump Rules star has vowed to
 'work as much as possible.' And after 'Scandoval
' made headlines in March 2023, Ariana used her time wisely. By June, she had signed partnerships with 10 brands. For instance, the Vanderpump Rules star chose
 Uber One, Bic Razors, Lay's, Glad and Duracell, and Bellesa sex toys for her deals.
 
And Ariana didn't hesitate to mock her cheating ex boyfriend in her social media endorsements for these brands.

Two masked attackers met their match last month when they attacked Los Angeles resident Vince Ricci as he walked toward the front door of his house. The pair brandished a firearm at Ricci, who pulled out his own gun and shot at the thugs, who ran away.


Ricci successfully defended not only himself but his wife and baby daughter, who were inside.


Like millions of other Americans, Ricci is a law-abiding gun owner who carries a firearm for protection.


Well, he used to be.


After the attack, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department suspended Ricci's concealed carry permit for reasons that are still unclear. His attackers were still at large, and he said he worries that his family will '

Despite repeated attempts by gun control advocates to downplay the importance of armed self-defense, successful defensive gun uses such as Ricci's actions are far from a rare occurrence. Almost every major study has found that Americans use their firearms in self-defense between

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan's Supreme Court is keeping former President Donald Trump on the state's primary election ballot.

The court said Wednesday it will not hear an appeal of a lower court's ruling from groups seeking to keep Trump from appearing on the ballot.

The state's high court said in an order that the application by parties to appeal a Dec. 14 Michigan appeals court judgment was considered, but denied 'because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court.'

The ruling followed a Dec. 19 decision by a divided Colorado Supreme Court which found Trump ineligible to be president because of his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. That ruling was the first time in history that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment has been used to disqualify a presidential candidate.

The Michigan and Colorado cases are among dozens hoping to keep Trump's name off state ballots. They all point to the so-called insurrection clause that prevents anyone from holding office who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' against the Constitution.

Trump pressed two election officials in Michigan's Wayne County not to certify 2020 vote totals, according to a recording of a post-election phone call disclosed in a Dec. 22 report by The Detroit News. The former president ‘s 2024 campaign has neither confirmed nor denied the recording's legitimacy.

Attorneys for Free Speech for People, a liberal nonprofit group also involved in efforts to keep Trump's name off the primary ballot in Minnesota, had asked Michigan's Supreme Court to render its decision by Christmas Day.

The group argued that time was 'of the essence' due to 'the pressing need to finalize and print the ballots for the presidential primary election.'

Earlier this month, Michigan's high court refused to immediately hear an appeal, saying the case should remain before the appeals court.

Free Speech for People had sued to force Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to bar Trump from Michigan's ballot. But a Michigan Court of Claims judge rejected their arguments, saying in November that it was the proper role of Congress to decide the question., media=https://wislawjournal.com/files/2023/08/AP23237059271001-scaled.jpg, _id=ef089134262d2854d8e2c9c5c38c34cb}]

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan's Supreme Court is keeping former President Donald Trump on the state's primary election ballot.

The court said Wednesday it will not hear an appeal of a lower court's ruling from groups seeking to keep Trump from appearing on the ballot.

The state's high court said in an order that the application by parties to appeal a Dec. 14 Michigan appeals court judgment was considered, but denied 'because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court.'

The ruling followed a Dec. 19 decision by a divided Colorado Supreme Court which found Trump ineligible to be president because of his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. That ruling was the first time in history that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment has been used to disqualify a presidential candidate.

The Michigan and Colorado cases are among dozens hoping to keep Trump's name off state ballots. They all point to the so-called insurrection clause that prevents anyone from holding office who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' against the Constitution.

Trump pressed two election officials in Michigan's Wayne County not to certify 2020 vote totals, according to a recording of a post-election phone call disclosed in a Dec. 22 report by The Detroit News. The former president ‘s 2024 campaign has neither confirmed nor denied the recording's legitimacy.

Attorneys for Free Speech for People, a liberal nonprofit group also involved in efforts to keep Trump's name off the primary ballot in Minnesota, had asked Michigan's Supreme Court to render its decision by Christmas Day.

The group argued that time was 'of the essence' due to 'the pressing need to finalize and print the ballots for the presidential primary election.'

Earlier this month, Michigan's high court refused to immediately hear an appeal, saying the case should remain before the appeals court.

Free Speech for People had sued to force Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to bar Trump from Michigan's ballot. But a Michigan Court of Claims judge rejected their arguments, saying in November that it was the proper role of Congress to decide the question., media=https://wislawjournal.com/files/2023/08/AP23237059271001-scaled.jpg, _id=ef089134262d2854d8e2c9c5c38c34cb}]

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan's Supreme Court is keeping former President Donald Trump on the state's primary election ballot.

The court said Wednesday it will not hear an appeal of a lower court's ruling from groups seeking to keep Trump from appearing on the ballot.

The state's high court said in an order that the application by parties to appeal a Dec. 14 Michigan appeals court judgment was considered, but denied 'because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this court.'

The ruling followed a Dec. 19 decision by a divided Colorado Supreme Court which found Trump ineligible to be president because of his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. That ruling was the first time in history that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment has been used to disqualify a presidential candidate.

The Michigan and Colorado cases are among dozens hoping to keep Trump's name off state ballots. They all point to the so-called insurrection clause that prevents anyone from holding office who 'engaged in insurrection or rebellion' against the Constitution.

Trump pressed two election officials in Michigan's Wayne County not to certify 2020 vote totals, according to a recording of a post-election phone call disclosed in a Dec. 22 report by The Detroit News. The former president ‘s 2024 campaign has neither confirmed nor denied the recording's legitimacy.

Attorneys for Free Speech for People, a liberal nonprofit group also involved in efforts to keep Trump's name off the primary ballot in Minnesota, had asked Michigan's Supreme Court to render its decision by Christmas Day.

The group argued that time was 'of the essence' due to 'the pressing need to finalize and print the ballots for the presidential primary election.'

Earlier this month, Michigan's high court refused to immediately hear an appeal, saying the case should remain before the appeals court.

Free Speech for People had sued to force Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to bar Trump from Michigan's ballot. But a Michigan Court of Claims judge rejected their arguments, saying in November that it was the proper role of Congress to decide the question., media=https://wislawjournal.com/files/2023/08/AP23237059271001-scaled.jpg, _id=ef089134262d2854d8e2c9c5c38c34cb}]

CEBU CITY, Philippines—- The Cebu City Niños secured the fifth position in the overall medal tally during the recently concluded Batang Pinoy National Championships and Philippine National Games (PNG) held in Manila.


The dual multi-sport meet took place from December 17 to 22, 2023, across various sports venues in Manila.


The final medal count was not available until Wednesday, December 27, 2023, on the Philippine  Commission (PSC) Facebook page.


Despite the successful conclusion, the PSC received numerous complaints from participating local government units (LGUs).
 
The Iloilo City delegation raised concerns about the purported lack of sleeping beds, unclean comfort rooms, and the absence of essential amenities in their billeting quarters.


Other participants voiced complaints regarding the confusing procedure for the distribution of allowances.


Amidst these hosting issues, Cebu City exceeded its previous medal count from the Batang Pinoy National Championships in 2022, where they secured the 13th overall position in Vigan City, Ilocos Sur, with nine gold medals, 12 silvers, and 26 bronzes.


This time, the Niños concluded with an impressive total of 39 gold medals, 43 silvers, and 46 bronzes, securing the fifth overall position.


They trailed behind fourth-placed Quezon City with a 44-35-48 (gold-silver-bronze) tally and Davao City with a 47-50-39 count. Pasig City claimed the second spot with a 57-56-74 medal haul, while perennial overall champion Baguio City retained the top position with an 82-52-59 tally.
 
Cebu City attributed its success to the achievements of its dancesports athletes, gymnasts, and archers, who contributed significantly to the gold medal count, securing the fifth position overall in the medal standings.


The Cebu City delegation comprised a total of 780 athletes, coaches, and officials for the Batang Pinoy National Championships and PNG, supported by the Cebu City  Commission.


In the PNG, Cebu City secured the fifth position with a medal haul of 13 gold, 14 silver, and 17 bronze.


Pasig City led the medal tally with 42-39-47, followed by Mandaluyong City in second place with a 35-42-39 tally.


Baguio City (35-41-49) and Davao City (24-30-22) secured the third and fourth positions, respectively.

CEBU CITY, Philippines—- The Cebu City Niños secured the fifth position in the overall medal tally during the recently concluded Batang Pinoy National Championships and Philippine National Games (PNG) held in Manila.


The dual multi-sport meet took place from December 17 to 22, 2023, across various sports venues in Manila.


The final medal count was not available until Wednesday, December 27, 2023, on the Philippine  Commission (PSC) Facebook page.


Despite the successful conclusion, the PSC received numerous complaints from participating local government units (LGUs).
 
The Iloilo City delegation raised concerns about the purported lack of sleeping beds, unclean comfort rooms, and the absence of essential amenities in their billeting quarters.


Other participants voiced complaints regarding the confusing procedure for the distribution of allowances.


Amidst these hosting issues, Cebu City exceeded its previous medal count from the Batang Pinoy National Championships in 2022, where they secured the 13th overall position in Vigan City, Ilocos Sur, with nine gold medals, 12 silvers, and 26 bronzes.


This time, the Niños concluded with an impressive total of 39 gold medals, 43 silvers, and 46 bronzes, securing the fifth overall position.


They trailed behind fourth-placed Quezon City with a 44-35-48 (gold-silver-bronze) tally and Davao City with a 47-50-39 count. Pasig City claimed the second spot with a 57-56-74 medal haul, while perennial overall champion Baguio City retained the top position with an 82-52-59 tally.
 
Cebu City attributed its success to the achievements of its dancesports athletes, gymnasts, and archers, who contributed significantly to the gold medal count, securing the fifth position overall in the medal standings.


The Cebu City delegation comprised a total of 780 athletes, coaches, and officials for the Batang Pinoy National Championships and PNG, supported by the Cebu City  Commission.


In the PNG, Cebu City secured the fifth position with a medal haul of 13 gold, 14 silver, and 17 bronze.


Pasig City led the medal tally with 42-39-47, followed by Mandaluyong City in second place with a 35-42-39 tally.


Baguio City (35-41-49) and Davao City (24-30-22) secured the third and fourth positions, respectively.

CEBU CITY, Philippines—- The Cebu City Niños secured the fifth position in the overall medal tally during the recently concluded Batang Pinoy National Championships and Philippine National Games (PNG) held in Manila.


The dual multi-sport meet took place from December 17 to 22, 2023, across various sports venues in Manila.


The final medal count was not available until Wednesday, December 27, 2023, on the Philippine  Commission (PSC) Facebook page.


Despite the successful conclusion, the PSC received numerous complaints from participating local government units (LGUs).
 
The Iloilo City delegation raised concerns about the purported lack of sleeping beds, unclean comfort rooms, and the absence of essential amenities in their billeting quarters.


Other participants voiced complaints regarding the confusing procedure for the distribution of allowances.


Amidst these hosting issues, Cebu City exceeded its previous medal count from the Batang Pinoy National Championships in 2022, where they secured the 13th overall position in Vigan City, Ilocos Sur, with nine gold medals, 12 silvers, and 26 bronzes.


This time, the Niños concluded with an impressive total of 39 gold medals, 43 silvers, and 46 bronzes, securing the fifth overall position.


They trailed behind fourth-placed Quezon City with a 44-35-48 (gold-silver-bronze) tally and Davao City with a 47-50-39 count. Pasig City claimed the second spot with a 57-56-74 medal haul, while perennial overall champion Baguio City retained the top position with an 82-52-59 tally.
 
Cebu City attributed its success to the achievements of its dancesports athletes, gymnasts, and archers, who contributed significantly to the gold medal count, securing the fifth position overall in the medal standings.


The Cebu City delegation comprised a total of 780 athletes, coaches, and officials for the Batang Pinoy National Championships and PNG, supported by the Cebu City  Commission.


In the PNG, Cebu City secured the fifth position with a medal haul of 13 gold, 14 silver, and 17 bronze.


Pasig City led the medal tally with 42-39-47, followed by Mandaluyong City in second place with a 35-42-39 tally.


Baguio City (35-41-49) and Davao City (24-30-22) secured the third and fourth positions, respectively.

With a combined weighting of 28% in the S&P 500, the "Magnificent Seven" are poised to see more gains in 2024. Goldman Sachs predicts these seven stocks to outshine the remaining 493 stocks in the S&P 500 in 2024 too (read: 
5 Tech ETFs that Crushed the Magnificent Seven ETFs in 2023
).
We have cited several reasons for the expected solid performances in 2024:
Unstoppable AI Boom:
 Nvidia emerged as a major beneficiary of the AI boom in 2023, returning a whopping 239% followed by Meta Platform, which saw its shares surging an impressive 191%. Amazon gained more than 80% in 2023, as the e-commerce giant advanced in the AI space. Shares of Alphabet and Microsoft climbed about 60% in 2023 amid enthusiasm for the company's AI-related advancements.
The craze for AI is expected to stay in 2024 with many experts believing that the AI journey of these market leaders has just begun, and more innovations in this field will unfold.
Cloud Computing's Bright Prospects:
 Cloud computing, a sector dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, remains a promising area. The cloud infrastructure services market is projected to grow from $122 billion in 2023 to $446 billion by 2032. Despite economic concerns prompting a cost-reduction focus among some customers, the sector's revenue impact remains minimal. However, Amazon's e-commerce business is facing increased competition, notably from Walmart, affecting its share value.

) released preliminary insights about consumer spending trends across different categories this holiday season in its SpendingPulse report. Not adjusted for inflation, Mastercard SpendingPulse measures in-store and online retail sales across all payment types.
According to the latest report, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, improved 3.1% during the holiday season, which ran from Nov 1 to Dec 24 of this year, from the prior-year comparable period. However, the growth rate has fallen short of Mastercard's holiday season expectation of a 3.7% increase, revealed in September 2023, as well as the prior-year comparable period's registered growth of 7.6%.
While revealing their expectation this September, Mastercard management had already stated that consumers were likely to be highly picky and value-focused while spending during the 2023 holiday season amid access to a wide array of choices and a tighter budget constraint. Continued inflationary challenges may have made consumers more cautious about spending while favorable employment rates provided some respite. Personalized promotions of retailers from an early point of this year's holiday season enabled consumers to get hold of the best deals and promotions.
Delving deeper into the retail trends, E-commerce and in-store sales witnessed year-over-year improvements of 6.3% and 2.2%, respectively, in the holiday season. Online retail sales witnessed a faster growth rate than in-store, attributable to the ease and affordability of online shopping.
As family and friends assembled in restaurants to celebrate the festivities outside of homes, restaurant spending notably climbed 7.8% this holiday season from the prior-year comparable period. It was higher than Mastercard's growth expectation of 5.4%. Apparel sales rose 2.4% year over year. Additionally, the growth streak for grocery item sales, which are essential in nature, continued with a 2.1% increase during the holidays.  
However, it seems that consumers were in no mood to expend considerable funds on electronics and jewelry. As a result, sales of these two categories declined 0.4% and 2%, respectively, from the corresponding year-ago comparable period's figures.
The findings of Mastercard SpendingPulse take into account aggregate sales activity in the tech giant's payment network. Therefore, expanding U.S. retail sales in the 2023 holiday season implies an increase in the number of transactions being pro, media=https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/15/497.jpg, _id=e4598dcca7e3b37b96f1c31ac3997ac3}, {wishlistId=263, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=FDA Rejects Amgen's (AMGN) NDA Seeking Full Nod for Lumakras, author=Zacks Investment Research, link=https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2202718/fda-rejects-amgens-amgn-nda-seeking-full-nod-for-lumakras, summary=Amgen

) announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to its new drug application (NDA) seeking full approval for Lumakras (sotorasib) for adult patients with previously-treated KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Per the CRL, the FDA issued a new post-market requirement for Amgen to conduct an additional confirmatory study on Lumakras to support the drug's full approval. This study needs to be completed by February 2028.
The accelerated approval status granted to Lumakras in 2021 remains in force, with once-daily dosing at 960 mg.
This decision is in line with the issues raised by an FDA advisory committee on the Lumakras NDA in October. The committee members voted 10-to-2, expressing skepticism on relying on the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) in Amgen's previously-conducted confirmatory study (CodeBreak 200)to assess Lumakras' benefits.
Management has yet to disclose its next steps or plans for the drug.
Year to date, Amgen's shares have risen 8.1% against the

Following the accelerated approval, Lumakras became the first and only targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, which is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC patients. Per management, around 13% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.
Apart from NSCLC, Amgen is also evaluating the drug in clinical studies as a potential treatment for KRAS G12C-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). In October, Amgen reported data from a phase III study which showed that treatment with Lumakras, combined with Vectibix, demonstrated a statistically significant superiority in PFS over the investigator's choice of therapy in patients with chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic CRC.

 — are responsible for 76% of the S&P 500's 2023 rise and represent a collective $11.5 trillion in market value.
With a combined weighting of 28% in the S&P 500, the "Magnificent Seven" are poised to see more gains in 2024. Goldman Sachs predicts these seven stocks to outshine the remaining 493 stocks in the S&P 500 in 2024 too (read: 
5 Tech ETFs that Crushed the Magnificent Seven ETFs in 2023
).
We have cited several reasons for the expected solid performances in 2024:
Unstoppable AI Boom:
 Nvidia emerged as a major beneficiary of the AI boom in 2023, returning a whopping 239% followed by Meta Platform, which saw its shares surging an impressive 191%. Amazon gained more than 80% in 2023, as the e-commerce giant advanced in the AI space. Shares of Alphabet and Microsoft climbed about 60% in 2023 amid enthusiasm for the company's AI-related advancements.
The craze for AI is expected to stay in 2024 with many experts believing that the AI journey of these market leaders has just begun, and more innovations in this field will unfold.
Cloud Computing's Bright Prospects:
 Cloud computing, a sector dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, remains a promising area. The cloud infrastructure services market is projected to grow from $122 billion in 2023 to $446 billion by 2032. Despite economic concerns prompting a cost-reduction focus among some customers, the sector's revenue impact remains minimal. However, Amazon's e-commerce business is facing increased competition, notably from Walmart, affecting its share value.

 — are responsible for 76% of the S&P 500's 2023 rise and represent a collective $11.5 trillion in market value.
With a combined weighting of 28% in the S&P 500, the "Magnificent Seven" are poised to see more gains in 2024. Goldman Sachs predicts these seven stocks to outshine the remaining 493 stocks in the S&P 500 in 2024 too (read: 
5 Tech ETFs that Crushed the Magnificent Seven ETFs in 2023
).
We have cited several reasons for the expected solid performances in 2024:
Unstoppable AI Boom:
 Nvidia emerged as a major beneficiary of the AI boom in 2023, returning a whopping 239% followed by Meta Platform, which saw its shares surging an impressive 191%. Amazon gained more than 80% in 2023, as the e-commerce giant advanced in the AI space. Shares of Alphabet and Microsoft climbed about 60% in 2023 amid enthusiasm for the company's AI-related advancements.
The craze for AI is expected to stay in 2024 with many experts believing that the AI journey of these market leaders has just begun, and more innovations in this field will unfold.
Cloud Computing's Bright Prospects:
 Cloud computing, a sector dominated by Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, remains a promising area. The cloud infrastructure services market is projected to grow from $122 billion in 2023 to $446 billion by 2032. Despite economic concerns prompting a cost-reduction focus among some customers, the sector's revenue impact remains minimal. However, Amazon's e-commerce business is facing increased competition, notably from Walmart, affecting its share value.
Solid Fundamentals:
 Goldman Sachs explains that these mega-cap tech stocks have superior fundamentals compared to the rest of the S&P 500.

) released preliminary insights about consumer spending trends across different categories this holiday season in its SpendingPulse report. Not adjusted for inflation, Mastercard SpendingPulse measures in-store and online retail sales across all payment types.
According to the latest report, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, improved 3.1% during the holiday season, which ran from Nov 1 to Dec 24 of this year, from the prior-year comparable period. However, the growth rate has fallen short of Mastercard's holiday season expectation of a 3.7% increase, revealed in September 2023, as well as the prior-year comparable period's registered growth of 7.6%.
While revealing their expectation this September, Mastercard management had already stated that consumers were likely to be highly picky and value-focused while spending during the 2023 holiday season amid access to a wide array of choices and a tighter budget constraint. Continued inflationary challenges may have made consumers more cautious about spending while favorable employment rates provided some respite. Personalized promotions of retailers from an early point of this year's holiday season enabled consumers to get hold of the best deals and promotions.
Delving deeper into the retail trends, E-commerce and in-store sales witnessed year-over-year improvements of 6.3% and 2.2%, respectively, in the holiday season. Online retail sales witnessed a faster growth rate than in-store, attributable to the ease and affordability of online shopping.
As family and friends assembled in restaurants to celebrate the festivities outside of homes, restaurant spending notably climbed 7.8% this holiday season from the prior-year comparable period. It was higher than Mastercard's growth expectation of 5.4%. Apparel sales rose 2.4% year over year. Additionally, the growth streak for grocery item sales, which are essential in nature, continued with a 2.1% increase during the holidays.  
However, it seems that consumers were in no mood to expend considerable funds on electronics and jewelry. As a result, sales of these two categories declined 0.4% and 2%, respectively, from the corresponding year-ago comparable period's figures.
The findings of Mastercard SpendingPulse take into account aggregate sales activity in the tech giant's payment network. Therefore, expanding U.S. retail sales in the 2023 holiday season implies an increase in the number of transactions being pro, media=https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/15/497.jpg, _id=e4598dcca7e3b37b96f1c31ac3997ac3}, {wishlistId=263, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=FDA Rejects Amgen's (AMGN) NDA Seeking Full Nod for Lumakras, author=Zacks Investment Research, link=https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2202718/fda-rejects-amgens-amgn-nda-seeking-full-nod-for-lumakras, summary=Amgen

) announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to its new drug application (NDA) seeking full approval for Lumakras (sotorasib) for adult patients with previously-treated KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Per the CRL, the FDA issued a new post-market requirement for Amgen to conduct an additional confirmatory study on Lumakras to support the drug's full approval. This study needs to be completed by February 2028.
The accelerated approval status granted to Lumakras in 2021 remains in force, with once-daily dosing at 960 mg.
This decision is in line with the issues raised by an FDA advisory committee on the Lumakras NDA in October. The committee members voted 10-to-2, expressing skepticism on relying on the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) in Amgen's previously-conducted confirmatory study (CodeBreak 200)to assess Lumakras' benefits.
Management has yet to disclose its next steps or plans for the drug.
Year to date, Amgen's shares have risen 8.1% against the

's 16.1% decline.

Following the accelerated approval, Lumakras became the first and only targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, which is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC patients. Per management, around 13% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.
Apart from NSCLC, Amgen is also evaluating the drug in clinical studies as a potential treatment for KRAS G12C-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). In October, Amgen reported data from a phase III study which showed that treatment with Lumakras, combined with Vectibix, demonstrated a statistically significant superiority in PFS over the investigator's choice of therapy in patients with chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic CRC.

) released preliminary insights about consumer spending trends across different categories this holiday season in its SpendingPulse report. Not adjusted for inflation, Mastercard SpendingPulse measures in-store and online retail sales across all payment types.
According to the latest report, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, improved 3.1% during the holiday season, which ran from Nov 1 to Dec 24 of this year, from the prior-year comparable period. However, the growth rate has fallen short of Mastercard's holiday season expectation of a 3.7% increase, revealed in September 2023, as well as the prior-year comparable period's registered growth of 7.6%.
While revealing their expectation this September, Mastercard management had already stated that consumers were likely to be highly picky and value-focused while spending during the 2023 holiday season amid access to a wide array of choices and a tighter budget constraint. Continued inflationary challenges may have made consumers more cautious about spending while favorable employment rates provided some respite. Personalized promotions of retailers from an early point of this year's holiday season enabled consumers to get hold of the best deals and promotions.
Delving deeper into the retail trends, E-commerce and in-store sales witnessed year-over-year improvements of 6.3% and 2.2%, respectively, in the holiday season. Online retail sales witnessed a faster growth rate than in-store, attributable to the ease and affordability of online shopping.
As family and friends assembled in restaurants to celebrate the festivities outside of homes, restaurant spending notably climbed 7.8% this holiday season from the prior-year comparable period. It was higher than Mastercard's growth expectation of 5.4%. Apparel sales rose 2.4% year over year. Additionally, the growth streak for grocery item sales, which are essential in nature, continued with a 2.1% increase during the holidays.  
However, it seems that consumers were in no mood to expend considerable funds on electronics and jewelry. As a result, sales of these two categories declined 0.4% and 2%, respectively, from the corresponding year-ago comparable period's figures.
The findings of Mastercard SpendingPulse take into account aggregate sales activity in the tech giant's payment network. Therefore, expanding U.S. retail sales in the 2023 holiday season implies an increase in the number of transactions being pro, media=https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/main/15/497.jpg, _id=e4598dcca7e3b37b96f1c31ac3997ac3}, {wishlistId=263, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=FDA Rejects Amgen's (AMGN) NDA Seeking Full Nod for Lumakras, author=Zacks Investment Research, link=https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2202718/fda-rejects-amgens-amgn-nda-seeking-full-nod-for-lumakras, summary=Amgen

) announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to its new drug application (NDA) seeking full approval for Lumakras (sotorasib) for adult patients with previously-treated KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Per the CRL, the FDA issued a new post-market requirement for Amgen to conduct an additional confirmatory study on Lumakras to support the drug's full approval. This study needs to be completed by February 2028.
The accelerated approval status granted to Lumakras in 2021 remains in force, with once-daily dosing at 960 mg.
This decision is in line with the issues raised by an FDA advisory committee on the Lumakras NDA in October. The committee members voted 10-to-2, expressing skepticism on relying on the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) in Amgen's previously-conducted confirmatory study (CodeBreak 200)to assess Lumakras' benefits.
Management has yet to disclose its next steps or plans for the drug.
Year to date, Amgen's shares have risen 8.1% against the 
industry
's 16.1% decline.

Following the accelerated approval, Lumakras became the first and only targeted treatment for the KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, which is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC patients. Per management, around 13% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.
Apart from NSCLC, Amgen is also evaluating the drug in clinical studies as a potential treatment for KRAS G12C-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). In October, Amgen reported data from a phase III study which showed that treatment with Lumakras, combined with Vectibix, demonstrated a statistically significant superiority in PFS over the investigator's choice of therapy in patients with chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic CRC.
This news is likely to benefit rival

Currently, the only approved product in MRTX's portfolio, Krazati, sales are driving its top line. In the first nine months of 2023, Mirati recorded around $36 million from Krazati sales, which is encouraging for a newly approved drug. Mirati is also evaluating Krazati in CRC indication.

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA—According to a statement released by the University of California, Davis, analysis of more than 1,100 projectile points from the Lake Titicaca Basin suggests that archery developed in the Andes Mountains some 5,000 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. Luis Flores-Blanco of UC Davis, Lucero Cuellar of the National University of San Marcos, Mark Aldenderfer of the University of California, Merced, and their colleagues examined the stone points, which had been made over a period of about 10,000 years. They found that the older points were larger. Then, about 5,000 years ago, the points became significantly smaller. The researchers suggest that this shift reflects a change from a preference for spear-throwing to the use of bows and arrows. Flores-Blanco explained that this shift in technology emerged at about the same time as obsidian exchange networks expanded and people began to live in larger settlements. 'Bow-and-arrow technology could have maintained and ensured adherence to emerging social norms that were crucial,' he suggested.

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

On Saturday, Bangladesh bowled out New Zealand for 98 on the same pitch to set up a nine-wicket win in the third one-day international, its first limited-overs victory over the Black Caps on their home soil.


Four days later Bangladesh claimed three wickets with the first nine balls of the New Zealand innings and contained the home side to 134-9. The Black Caps were 1-3 after Shoriful Islam dismissed Finn Allen and Glenn Phillips with consecutive balls in the second over, and then 20-4 following the fall of Daryl Mitchell.


Jimmy Neesham made 48 and captain Mitchell Santner 23 as New Zealand staged a partial recovery.


Das led an unhurried run chase that saw Bangladesh reach its target with eight balls to spare. The opener was given out lbw to Tim Southee when he was 22 but had the decision reversed under review and stayed on to steady the innings later.


He needed medical treatment for a leg injury at the start of the 18th over when he was 29 and Bangladesh needed 24 from 18 balls. On 33, and with 20 needed from 16 balls, his lofted shot found Ish Sodhi at fine-leg but the fielder stepped over the boundary line in completing a simple catch, giving Das another reprieve.


Clearly impeded while running between the wickets, Das was able to look on from the non-striker's end as Mahedi Hasan (19 not out) finished the chase with a six and a four off Adam Milne in the 19th over.


Earlier, Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto entrusted the first over to off-spinner Mahedi and the decision paid off when he bowled Tim Seifert with the fourth ball.


'In these conditions spin bowling is hard but I was able to get my execution right,' said Mahedi who was Player of the Match for his all-round performance.


'I hit the right areas in the power play and was able to do a good job for my team. When I bowl well, then I am able to bat confidently and finish the job for my team.'


Seifert went back to a delivery from Mahedi that he tried to dab wide of slip. But the ball kept low, skipped on and hit his middle stump.


Shoriful then followed up his effort in the third one-dayer, where he took three wickets, with a double strike in the second over. Allen threw his hands, without moving his feet, to a ball going across him and was caught at slip.

 is set to collaborate with renowned iPhone designer Jony Ive and AI expert Sam Altman on a new venture focusing on artificial intelligence hardware, 
reports
 
Bloomberg
.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA—According to a statement released by the University of California, Davis, analysis of more than 1,100 projectile points from the Lake Titicaca Basin suggests that archery developed in the Andes Mountains some 5,000 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. Luis Flores-Blanco of UC Davis, Lucero Cuellar of the National University of San Marcos, Mark Aldenderfer of the University of California, Merced, and their colleagues examined the stone points, which had been made over a period of about 10,000 years. They found that the older points were larger. Then, about 5,000 years ago, the points became significantly smaller. The researchers suggest that this shift reflects a change from a preference for spear-throwing to the use of bows and arrows. Flores-Blanco explained that this shift in technology emerged at about the same time as obsidian exchange networks expanded and people began to live in larger settlements. 'Bow-and-arrow technology could have maintained and ensured adherence to emerging social norms that were crucial,' he suggested.

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

On 33, and with 20 needed from 16 balls, his lofted shot found Ish Sodhi at fine-leg but the fielder stepped over the boundary line in completing a simple catch, giving Das another reprieve.


Clearly impeded while running between the wickets, Das was able to look on from the non-striker's end as Mahedi Hasan (19 not out) finished the chase with a six and a four off Adam Milne in the 19th over.


Earlier, Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto entrusted the first over to off-spinner Mahedi and the decision paid off when he bowled Tim Seifert with the fourth ball.


'In these conditions spin bowling is hard but I was able to get my execution right,' said Mahedi who was Player of the Match for his all-round performance.


'I hit the right areas in the power play and was able to do a good job for my team. When I bowl well, then I am able to bat confidently and finish the job for my team.'


Seifert went back to a delivery from Mahedi that he tried to dab wide of slip. But the ball kept low, skipped on and hit his middle stump.


Shoriful then followed up his effort in the third one-dayer, where he took three wickets, with a double strike in the second over. Allen threw his hands, without moving his feet, to a ball going across him and was caught at slip.

.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For now, a fed, media=https://www.postnewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/728x90_Photo-C.jpg, _id=27ede1e051a83287a515a7fe1d272036}, {wishlistId=275, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Newbridge Financial Services Group Inc.

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA—According to a statement released by the University of California, Davis, analysis of more than 1,100 projectile points from the Lake Titicaca Basin suggests that archery developed in the Andes Mountains some 5,000 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. Luis Flores-Blanco of UC Davis, Lucero Cuellar of the National University of San Marcos, Mark Aldenderfer of the University of California, Merced, and their colleagues examined the stone points, which had been made over a period of about 10,000 years. They found that the older points were larger. Then, about 5,000 years ago, the points became significantly smaller. The researchers suggest that this shift reflects a change from a preference for spear-throwing to the use of bows and arrows. Flores-Blanco explained that this shift in technology emerged at about the same time as obsidian exchange networks expanded and people began to live in larger settlements. 'Bow-and-arrow technology could have maintained and ensured adherence to emerging social norms that were crucial,' he suggested.

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

On Saturday, Bangladesh bowled out New Zealand for 98 on the same pitch to set up a nine-wicket win in the third one-day international, its first limited-overs victory over the Black Caps on their home soil.


Four days later Bangladesh claimed three wickets with the first nine balls of the New Zealand innings and contained the home side to 134-9. The Black Caps were 1-3 after Shoriful Islam dismissed Finn Allen and Glenn Phillips with consecutive balls in the second over, and then 20-4 following the fall of Daryl Mitchell.


Jimmy Neesham made 48 and captain Mitchell Santner 23 as New Zealand staged a partial recovery.


Das led an unhurried run chase that saw Bangladesh reach its target with eight balls to spare. The opener was given out lbw to Tim Southee when he was 22 but had the decision reversed under review and stayed on to steady the innings later.


He needed medical treatment for a leg injury at the start of the 18th over when he was 29 and Bangladesh needed 24 from 18 balls. On 33, and with 20 needed from 16 balls, his lofted shot found Ish Sodhi at fine-leg but the fielder stepped over the boundary line in completing a simple catch, giving Das another reprieve.


Clearly impeded while running between the wickets, Das was able to look on from the non-striker's end as Mahedi Hasan (19 not out) finished the chase with a six and a four off Adam Milne in the 19th over.

Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.

, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For now, a fed, media=https://www.postnewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/728x90_Photo-C.jpg, _id=27ede1e051a83287a515a7fe1d272036}, {wishlistId=275, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Newbridge Financial Services Group Inc.

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA—According to a statement released by the University of California, Davis, analysis of more than 1,100 projectile points from the Lake Titicaca Basin suggests that archery developed in the Andes Mountains some 5,000 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. Luis Flores-Blanco of UC Davis, Lucero Cuellar of the National University of San Marcos, Mark Aldenderfer of the University of California, Merced, and their colleagues examined the stone points, which had been made over a period of about 10,000 years. They found that the older points were larger. Then, about 5,000 years ago, the points became significantly smaller. The researchers suggest that this shift reflects a change from a preference for spear-throwing to the use of bows and arrows. Flores-Blanco explained that this shift in technology emerged at about the same time as obsidian exchange networks expanded and people began to live in larger settlements. 'Bow-and-arrow technology could have maintained and ensured adherence to emerging social norms that were crucial,' he suggested.

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA—According to a statement released by the University of California, Davis, analysis of more than 1,100 projectile points from the Lake Titicaca Basin suggests that archery developed in the Andes Mountains some 5,000 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. Luis Flores-Blanco of UC Davis, Lucero Cuellar of the National University of San Marcos, Mark Aldenderfer of the University of California, Merced, and their colleagues examined the stone points, which had been made over a period of about 10,000 years. They found that the older points were larger. Then, about 5,000 years ago, the points became significantly smaller. The researchers suggest that this shift reflects a change from a preference for spear-throwing to the use of bows and arrows. Flores-Blanco explained that this shift in technology emerged at about the same time as obsidian exchange networks expanded and people began to live in larger settlements. 'Bow-and-arrow technology could have maintained and ensured adherence to emerging social norms that were crucial,' he suggested.

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

 is set to collaborate with renowned iPhone designer Jony Ive and AI expert Sam Altman on a new venture focusing on artificial intelligence hardware, 
reports
 
Bloomberg
.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA—According to a statement released by the University of California, Davis, analysis of more than 1,100 projectile points from the Lake Titicaca Basin suggests that archery developed in the Andes Mountains some 5,000 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. Luis Flores-Blanco of UC Davis, Lucero Cuellar of the National University of San Marcos, Mark Aldenderfer of the University of California, Merced, and their colleagues examined the stone points, which had been made over a period of about 10,000 years. They found that the older points were larger. Then, about 5,000 years ago, the points became significantly smaller. The researchers suggest that this shift reflects a change from a preference for spear-throwing to the use of bows and arrows. Flores-Blanco explained that this shift in technology emerged at about the same time as obsidian exchange networks expanded and people began to live in larger settlements. 'Bow-and-arrow technology could have maintained and ensured adherence to emerging social norms that were crucial,' he suggested.

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

 is set to collaborate with renowned iPhone designer Jony Ive and AI expert Sam Altman on a new venture focusing on artificial intelligence hardware, 
reports
 
Bloomberg
.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For now, a fed, media=https://www.postnewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/728x90_Photo-C.jpg, _id=27ede1e051a83287a515a7fe1d272036}, {wishlistId=275, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Newbridge Financial Services Group Inc.

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA—According to a statement released by the University of California, Davis, analysis of more than 1,100 projectile points from the Lake Titicaca Basin suggests that archery developed in the Andes Mountains some 5,000 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. Luis Flores-Blanco of UC Davis, Lucero Cuellar of the National University of San Marcos, Mark Aldenderfer of the University of California, Merced, and their colleagues examined the stone points, which had been made over a period of about 10,000 years. They found that the older points were larger. Then, about 5,000 years ago, the points became significantly smaller. The researchers suggest that this shift reflects a change from a preference for spear-throwing to the use of bows and arrows. Flores-Blanco explained that this shift in technology emerged at about the same time as obsidian exchange networks expanded and people began to live in larger settlements. 'Bow-and-arrow technology could have maintained and ensured adherence to emerging social norms that were crucial,' he suggested.

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA—According to a statement released by the University of California, Davis, analysis of more than 1,100 projectile points from the Lake Titicaca Basin suggests that archery developed in the Andes Mountains some 5,000 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. Luis Flores-Blanco of UC Davis, Lucero Cuellar of the National University of San Marcos, Mark Aldenderfer of the University of California, Merced, and their colleagues examined the stone points, which had been made over a period of about 10,000 years. They found that the older points were larger. Then, about 5,000 years ago, the points became significantly smaller. The researchers suggest that this shift reflects a change from a preference for spear-throwing to the use of bows and arrows. Flores-Blanco explained that this shift in technology emerged at about the same time as obsidian exchange networks expanded and people began to live in larger settlements. 'Bow-and-arrow technology could have maintained and ensured adherence to emerging social norms that were crucial,' he suggested.

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

 is set to collaborate with renowned iPhone designer Jony Ive and AI expert Sam Altman on a new venture focusing on artificial intelligence hardware, 
reports
 
Bloomberg
.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by 
Kiel University
, people who lived in large Neolithic settlements in the forest steppe northwest of the Black Sea some 6,000 years ago grew crops and kept animals, but they consumed a diet consisting mainly of grain and peas. As many as 15,000 people may have lived in these planned Trypillia societies, equipped with meeting houses and neighborhoods. Archaeologist Johannes Müller and archaeobotanist Wiebke Kirleis analyzed the isotopes in human and animal bones, and compared their chemical composition to isotope measurements taken from charred peas, cereal grains, and soil samples from several Trypillia settlements. They found that the peas were high in protein and provided essential amino acids. 'We concluded that a large proportion of the cattle and sheep were kept on fenced pastures,' said paleoecologist Frank Schlütz. 'Moreover, the manure of the animals produced there was used by people to intensively fertilize the peas in particular,' he added. Finally, the pea straw was then probably fed to the livestock.

 is set to collaborate with renowned iPhone designer Jony Ive and AI expert Sam Altman on a new venture focusing on artificial intelligence hardware, 
reports
 
Bloomberg
.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For now, a fed, media=https://www.postnewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/728x90_Photo-C.jpg, _id=27ede1e051a83287a515a7fe1d272036}, {wishlistId=275, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Newbridge Financial Services Group Inc.

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

 is set to collaborate with renowned iPhone designer Jony Ive and AI expert Sam Altman on a new venture focusing on artificial intelligence hardware, 
reports
 
Bloomberg
.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

For lovers of democracy (and if you are reading this surely that means you), the news has blessed us with some noteworthy early Christmas/Happy Holidays/seasonal gifting.

First, if you didn't feel a little warm glow when the news first broke, you have to understand that we are all Lady Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss.

You know them. They are the Georgia election workers, the ones who Trump's lawyer and now disgraced leaky hair colorist Rudy Giuliani said were passing a USB drive to each other — proof, somehow, of some digital malfeasance to help steal the 2020 election from Donald Trump.

In fact, there was no such attempt to steal anything from anybody. The USB drive was a piece of ginger candy.

The whole thing was a lie told by Giuliani to perpetuate the 'Big Lie,' that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.

Earlier a federal district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled that Giuliani's lies defamed Freeman and Moss, whose lives were turned upside down.

They couldn't go out in public for fear they'd be retaliated against by Trump's MAGA zealots. Freeman couldn't run her businesses. Moss began doubting democracy.

And then last week the jury ordered Giuliani to pay Freeman and Moss $148 million in damages. That breaks down to $75 million in punitive damages. Add $16.2 million in compensatory damages to Freeman, and $16.9 million to Moss, as well as $20 million to each of them for emotional suffering, and you have the price for justice in a defamation case.
That's what lies on top of lies will cost in America if you're Rudy Giuliani defending Donald Trump.

Giuliani didn't take the witness stand in his own defense. But he did talk to the media at every juncture saying just wait, he'd provide evidence backing him up. 'Stay tuned,' he said.

But he never did. When you're a liar, you lose in a court of law. The only place for you is the court of public opinion, which is why Giuliani kept lying in impromptu sidewalk press conferences. For all those lies, Freeman and Moss slapped Giuliani with a second defamation suit on Monday.

It's Giuliani as a combination lying and human ATM. Still, collecting money from him will be tougher than you think. Even Freeman and Moss admit while the $148 million award is good, no amount of money will undo the damage they incurred from lies told by Giuliani and Trump himself. (Trump actually named Freeman specifically on a recorded call. That's another suit waiting to happen).

.


Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI
, plans to provide the software infrastructure for this venture. Altman, who faced a brief dismissal from OpenAI in November before being reinstated, has reportedly engaged in fundraising activities for this and other projects, including discussions with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son for potential multibillion-dollar investments.


Current concepts under exploration include AI devices for home use
, says sources.


Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022
. Over 20 former Apple employees have since joined LoveFrom.


It's clear Ive has some pull on drawing out his former designers from Apple. You can bet Apple CEO Tim Cook isn't happy about that. Apple hasn't made any truly ‘breakthrough' products lately aside from the

Sources familiar with the matter have revealed that Tan, an outgoing executive from Apple, will be a part of 
Ive's design firm LoveFrom
, contributing to the design and functionality of new AI devices.


Since Ive's departure from Apple in 2019 to then establishing his design firm LoveFrom, this is seen as the next big thing for the famed designer. Ive, known for designing iconic Apple products such as the iMac, iPhone, and iPad under Steve Jobs, aims to transform this AI device project into a standalone company. However, the development is still in its nascent stages, primarily concentrating on talent acquisition and conceptualization.


Tan is expected to lead the hardware engineering aspect of the project while at LoveFrom. His exit from Apple as the vice president of iPhone and watch product design was recently reported, with his official departure scheduled for February.


Sam Altman, formerly the CEO of OpenAI

Tan's departure from Apple highlights a broader trend of design talent leaving the company. Since 2019, approximately 14 members of Ive's team at Apple have exited, leaving only a handful of designers who worked under Ive at Apple.


Apple, dealing with this wave of departures, chose not to appoint a new head of design following the exit of Evans Hankey, Ive's successor. Instead, Jeff Williams, Apple's COO, has been overseeing the design team.


LoveFrom, on the other hand, has been building a portfolio of prestigious clients, including Airbnb, Ferrari, and Moncler. The firm had a 
three-year consulting arrangement with Apple, which concluded in 2022

We thus start off this particular crystal-ball gazing session with an upbeat prediction from Canalys.

Personal computers

According to the technology analyst firm, full-year 2024 personal computer shipments are forecast to hit 267 million units, an eight per cent rise from 2023, helped, the company said, by 'tailwinds including the Windows refresh cycle and emergence of AI-capable and Arm-based devices.'

In a forecast released late last month, Canalys analyst Ben Yeh said the global PC market is on a recovery path, and set to return to 2019 shipment levels by next year. 'The impact of AI on the PC industry will be profound, with leading players across OEMs, processor manufacturers, and operating system providers focused on delivering new AI-capable models in 2024,' he said. 'These initiatives will bolster refresh demand, particularly in the commercial sector.'

The total shipment share of AI-capable PCs, he added, is 'expected to be about 19 per cent in 2024. This accounts for all M-series Mac products alongside the nascent offerings expected in the Windows ecosystem. However, as more compelling use-cases emerge and AI functionality becomes an expected feature, Canalys anticipates a fast ramp up in the development and adoption of AI-capable PCs.'

In a research note released in September, Canalys analyst Keiren Jessop wrote that the 'first deployments of AI-capable PCs to businesses will be limited to specific organization types and employee roles. Examples include research and development, developers, engineers, data analysts and artists.

'These early adopters will take advantage of AI-enabled PCs' faster processing power when working on specific tasks. Game developers will be able to generate entire levels based on a small manually created section that the AI trains itself with.

'Designers can give the AI rough sketches to build and iterate on. Scientists will be able to run complex models faster, as the processing doesn't have to do a round trip to the cloud.

Israeli forces raided a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities said Wednesday. The Israeli military also expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the territory.

Residents reported shelling and airstrikes in the tiny, cramped enclave, including the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, the southern city of Khan Younis and the southern town of Rafah, where tens of thousands have sought refuge in recent weeks. Much of northern Gaza was pounded to rubble weeks ago.

More than 20,900 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.

About 1,200 people were killed after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, with around 240 people taken hostage. Israel says it aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Currently:

— The U.N. appoints a former Dutch deputy premier and Mideast expert as its Gaza humanitarian coordinator.

— An Israeli airstrike in Syria kills a high-ranking Iranian general.

— Biden orders strikes on an Iranian-aligned group after three U.S. troops are wounded in drone attack in Iraq.

HAMAS IN A SPAT WITH IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD SPOKESMAN

BEIRUT — A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 was launched in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas promptly denied the claim, in a rare public spat between the Palestinian militant group and its main sponsor.

The paramilitary guard's spokesman Ramezan Sharif made the comments at a news conference where he threatened retaliation for the killing of another top Iranian military figure, Gen. Razi Mousavi, who was killed in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria , media=https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/favicon.ico, _id=b99f2f48ffb5b663086108728e17af32}, {wishlistId=290, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Palace renames police camps, PNP lots to honor distinguished officers, author=Jean Mangaluz, link=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880009/palace-renames-police-camps-pnp-lots-to-honor-distinguished-officers, summary=President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. REUTERS file photo


MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the renaming of five Philippine National Police (PNP) camps and lots while giving three other police properties after notable officers, said the Palace on Wednesday.


In Proclamation No. 429, Marcos ordered the renaming of five PNP camps and real properties.

'It is fitting to give honor to former servicemen who have shown patriotism, courage, and dedication in serving the provinces and municipalities to which they are assigned, and distinguished themselves in their service to the nation, by way of naming PNP facilities in their honor,' Marcos said in the order.

Notably, Tria was one of the PNP Special Action Force officers who died in the Mamasapano clash in 2014.


In a separate order, Marcos named three PNP properties in Proclamation No. 430 as follows:




Camp General Paulino T. Santos, Police Regional Office 12


Camp Private Andres P. Dadizon, Police Regional Office 8


Camp 2LT Carlos Rafael Pax Imperial, Police Regional Office 5

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

We thus start off this particular crystal-ball gazing session with an upbeat prediction from Canalys.

Personal computers

According to the technology analyst firm, full-year 2024 personal computer shipments are forecast to hit 267 million units, an eight per cent rise from 2023, helped, the company said, by 'tailwinds including the Windows refresh cycle and emergence of AI-capable and Arm-based devices.'

In a forecast released late last month, Canalys analyst Ben Yeh said the global PC market is on a recovery path, and set to return to 2019 shipment levels by next year. 'The impact of AI on the PC industry will be profound, with leading players across OEMs, processor manufacturers, and operating system providers focused on delivering new AI-capable models in 2024,' he said. 'These initiatives will bolster refresh demand, particularly in the commercial sector.'

The total shipment share of AI-capable PCs, he added, is 'expected to be about 19 per cent in 2024. This accounts for all M-series Mac products alongside the nascent offerings expected in the Windows ecosystem. However, as more compelling use-cases emerge and AI functionality becomes an expected feature, Canalys anticipates a fast ramp up in the development and adoption of AI-capable PCs.'

In a research note released in September, Canalys analyst Keiren Jessop wrote that the 'first deployments of AI-capable PCs to businesses will be limited to specific organization types and employee roles. Examples include research and development, developers, engineers, data analysts and artists.

'These early adopters will take advantage of AI-enabled PCs' faster processing power when working on specific tasks. Game developers will be able to generate entire levels based on a small manually created section that the AI trains itself with.

'Designers can give the AI rough sketches to build and iterate on. Scientists will be able to run complex models faster, as the processing doesn't have to do a round trip to the cloud. Developers and data analysts can use their PCs' AI capabilities to quickly identify trends in their data, all while having total confidence in their security as the data never leaves the devices.'

Israeli forces raided a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities said Wednesday. The Israeli military also expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the territory.

Residents reported shelling and airstrikes in the tiny, cramped enclave, including the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, the southern city of Khan Younis and the southern town of Rafah, where tens of thousands have sought refuge in recent weeks. Much of northern Gaza was pounded to rubble weeks ago.

More than 20,900 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.

About 1,200 people were killed after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, with around 240 people taken hostage. Israel says it aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Currently:

— The U.N. appoints a former Dutch deputy premier and Mideast expert as its Gaza humanitarian coordinator.

— An Israeli airstrike in Syria kills a high-ranking Iranian general.

— Biden orders strikes on an Iranian-aligned group after three U.S. troops are wounded in drone attack in Iraq.

HAMAS IN A SPAT WITH IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD SPOKESMAN

BEIRUT — A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 was launched in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas promptly denied the claim, in a rare public spat between the Palestinian militant group and its main sponsor.

The paramilitary guard's spokesman Ramezan Sharif made the comments at a news conference where he threatened retaliation for the killing of another top Iranian military figure, Gen. Razi Mousavi, who was killed in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria , media=https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/favicon.ico, _id=b99f2f48ffb5b663086108728e17af32}, {wishlistId=290, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Palace renames police camps, PNP lots to honor distinguished officers, author=Jean Mangaluz, link=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880009/palace-renames-police-camps-pnp-lots-to-honor-distinguished-officers, summary=President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. REUTERS file photo


MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the renaming of five Philippine National Police (PNP) camps and lots while giving three other police properties after notable officers, said the Palace on Wednesday.


In Proclamation No. 429, Marcos ordered the renaming of five PNP camps and real properties.

'It is fitting to give honor to former servicemen who have shown patriotism, courage, and dedication in serving the provinces and municipalities to which they are assigned, and distinguished themselves in their service to the nation, by way of naming PNP facilities in their honor,' Marcos said in the order.

The five newly named and renamed offices in the proclamation include:
 


Camp Brigadier General Ludovico Padilla Arejola in Pasacao, Camarines Sur


Camp Captain Salvador Jaucian Del Rosario Sr., in Bicol


Camp Colonel Juan Querubin Miranda (formerly the Camarines Sur Police Provincial Office)


Camp Police Max Jim Ramirez Tria (formerly the 504th Maneuver Company Regional Mobile Force Battalion 5)


Camp Brigadier General Efigenio C. Navarro (formerly the Camp Efiganio C Navaro, Police Regional Office Mimaropa Headquarters)




Notably, Tria was one of the PNP Special Action Force officers who died in the Mamasapano clash in 2014.


In a separate order, Marcos named three PNP properties in Proclamation No. 430 as follows:




Camp General Paulino T. Santos, Police Regional Office 12


Camp Private Andres P. Dadizon, Police Regional Office 8


Camp 2LT Carlos Rafael Pax Imperial, Police Regional Office 5

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

We thus start off this particular crystal-ball gazing session with an upbeat prediction from Canalys.

Personal computers

According to the technology analyst firm, full-year 2024 personal computer shipments are forecast to hit 267 million units, an eight per cent rise from 2023, helped, the company said, by 'tailwinds including the Windows refresh cycle and emergence of AI-capable and Arm-based devices.'

In a forecast released late last month, Canalys analyst Ben Yeh said the global PC market is on a recovery path, and set to return to 2019 shipment levels by next year. 'The impact of AI on the PC industry will be profound, with leading players across OEMs, processor manufacturers, and operating system providers focused on delivering new AI-capable models in 2024,' he said. 'These initiatives will bolster refresh demand, particularly in the commercial sector.'

The total shipment share of AI-capable PCs, he added, is 'expected to be about 19 per cent in 2024. This accounts for all M-series Mac products alongside the nascent offerings expected in the Windows ecosystem. However, as more compelling use-cases emerge and AI functionality becomes an expected feature, Canalys anticipates a fast ramp up in the development and adoption of AI-capable PCs.'

In a research note released in September, Canalys analyst Keiren Jessop wrote that the 'first deployments of AI-capable PCs to businesses will be limited to specific organization types and employee roles. Examples include research and development, developers, engineers, data analysts and artists.

'These early adopters will take advantage of AI-enabled PCs' faster processing power when working on specific tasks. Game developers will be able to generate entire levels based on a small manually created section that the AI trains itself with.

'Designers can give the AI rough sketches to build and iterate on. Scientists will be able to run complex models faster, as the processing doesn't have to do a round trip to the cloud. Developers and data analysts can use their PCs' AI capabilities to quickly identify trends in their data, all while having total confidence in their security as the data never leaves the devices.'

Israeli forces raided a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities said Wednesday. The Israeli military also expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the territory.

Residents reported shelling and airstrikes in the tiny, cramped enclave, including the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, the southern city of Khan Younis and the southern town of Rafah, where tens of thousands have sought refuge in recent weeks. Much of northern Gaza was pounded to rubble weeks ago.

More than 20,900 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.

About 1,200 people were killed after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, with around 240 people taken hostage. Israel says it aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Currently:

— The U.N. appoints a former Dutch deputy premier and Mideast expert as its Gaza humanitarian coordinator.

— An Israeli airstrike in Syria kills a high-ranking Iranian general.

— Biden orders strikes on an Iranian-aligned group after three U.S. troops are wounded in drone attack in Iraq.

HAMAS IN A SPAT WITH IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD SPOKESMAN

BEIRUT — A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 was launched in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas promptly denied the claim, in a rare public spat between the Palestinian militant group and its main sponsor.

The paramilitary guard's spokesman Ramezan Sharif made the comments at a news conference where he threatened retaliation for the killing of another top Iranian military figure, Gen. Razi Mousavi, who was killed in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria , media=https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/favicon.ico, _id=b99f2f48ffb5b663086108728e17af32}, {wishlistId=290, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Palace renames police camps, PNP lots to honor distinguished officers, author=Jean Mangaluz, link=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880009/palace-renames-police-camps-pnp-lots-to-honor-distinguished-officers, summary=President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. REUTERS file photo


MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the renaming of five Philippine National Police (PNP) camps and lots while giving three other police properties after notable officers, said the Palace on Wednesday.


In Proclamation No. 429, Marcos ordered the renaming of five PNP camps and real properties.

'It is fitting to give honor to former servicemen who have shown patriotism, courage, and dedication in serving the provinces and municipalities to which they are assigned, and distinguished themselves in their service to the nation, by way of naming PNP facilities in their honor,' Marcos said in the order.

The five newly named and renamed offices in the proclamation include:
 


Camp Brigadier General Ludovico Padilla Arejola in Pasacao, Camarines Sur


Camp Captain Salvador Jaucian Del Rosario Sr., in Bicol


Camp Colonel Juan Querubin Miranda (formerly the Camarines Sur Police Provincial Office)


Camp Police Max Jim Ramirez Tria (formerly the 504th Maneuver Company Regional Mobile Force Battalion 5)


Camp Brigadier General Efigenio C. Navarro (formerly the Camp Efiganio C Navaro, Police Regional Office Mimaropa Headquarters)




Notably, Tria was one of the PNP Special Action Force officers who died in the Mamasapano clash in 2014.


In a separate order, Marcos named three PNP properties in Proclamation No. 430 as follows:




Camp General Paulino T. Santos, Police Regional Office 12


Camp Private Andres P. Dadizon, Police Regional Office 8


Camp 2LT Carlos Rafael Pax Imperial, Police Regional Office 5

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

We thus start off this particular crystal-ball gazing session with an upbeat prediction from Canalys.

Personal computers

According to the technology analyst firm, full-year 2024 personal computer shipments are forecast to hit 267 million units, an eight per cent rise from 2023, helped, the company said, by 'tailwinds including the Windows refresh cycle and emergence of AI-capable and Arm-based devices.'

In a forecast released late last month, Canalys analyst Ben Yeh said the global PC market is on a recovery path, and set to return to 2019 shipment levels by next year. 'The impact of AI on the PC industry will be profound, with leading players across OEMs, processor manufacturers, and operating system providers focused on delivering new AI-capable models in 2024,' he said. 'These initiatives will bolster refresh demand, particularly in the commercial sector.'

The total shipment share of AI-capable PCs, he added, is 'expected to be about 19 per cent in 2024. This accounts for all M-series Mac products alongside the nascent offerings expected in the Windows ecosystem. However, as more compelling use-cases emerge and AI functionality becomes an expected feature, Canalys anticipates a fast ramp up in the development and adoption of AI-capable PCs.'

In a research note released in September, Canalys analyst Keiren Jessop wrote that the 'first deployments of AI-capable PCs to businesses will be limited to specific organization types and employee roles. Examples include research and development, developers, engineers, data analysts and artists.

'These early adopters will take advantage of AI-enabled PCs' faster processing power when working on specific tasks. Game developers will be able to generate entire levels based on a small manually created section that the AI trains itself with.

'Designers can give the AI rough sketches to build and iterate on. Scientists will be able to run complex models faster, as the processing doesn't have to do a round trip to the cloud. Developers and data analysts can use their PCs' AI capabilities to quickly identify trends in their data, all while having total confidence in their security as the data never leaves the devices.'

Israeli forces raided a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities said Wednesday. The Israeli military also expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the territory.

Residents reported shelling and airstrikes in the tiny, cramped enclave, including the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, the southern city of Khan Younis and the southern town of Rafah, where tens of thousands have sought refuge in recent weeks. Much of northern Gaza was pounded to rubble weeks ago.

More than 20,900 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.

About 1,200 people were killed after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, with around 240 people taken hostage. Israel says it aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Currently:

— The U.N. appoints a former Dutch deputy premier and Mideast expert as its Gaza humanitarian coordinator.

— An Israeli airstrike in Syria kills a high-ranking Iranian general.

— Biden orders strikes on an Iranian-aligned group after three U.S. troops are wounded in drone attack in Iraq.

HAMAS IN A SPAT WITH IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD SPOKESMAN

BEIRUT — A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 was launched in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas promptly denied the claim, in a rare public spat between the Palestinian militant group and its main sponsor.

The paramilitary guard's spokesman Ramezan Sharif made the comments at a news conference where he threatened retaliation for the killing of another top Iranian military figure, Gen. Razi Mousavi, who was killed in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria , media=https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/favicon.ico, _id=b99f2f48ffb5b663086108728e17af32}, {wishlistId=290, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Palace renames police camps, PNP lots to honor distinguished officers, author=Jean Mangaluz, link=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880009/palace-renames-police-camps-pnp-lots-to-honor-distinguished-officers, summary=President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. REUTERS file photo


MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the renaming of five Philippine National Police (PNP) camps and lots while giving three other police properties after notable officers, said the Palace on Wednesday.


In Proclamation No. 429, Marcos ordered the renaming of five PNP camps and real properties.

'It is fitting to give honor to former servicemen who have shown patriotism, courage, and dedication in serving the provinces and municipalities to which they are assigned, and distinguished themselves in their service to the nation, by way of naming PNP facilities in their honor,' Marcos said in the order.

The five newly named and renamed offices in the proclamation include:

Camp Captain Salvador Jaucian Del Rosario Sr., in Bicol


Camp Colonel Juan Querubin Miranda (formerly the Camarines Sur Police Provincial Office)


Camp Police Max Jim Ramirez Tria (formerly the 504th Maneuver Company Regional Mobile Force Battalion 5)


Camp Brigadier General Efigenio C. Navarro (formerly the Camp Efiganio C Navaro, Police Regional Office Mimaropa Headquarters)




Notably, Tria was one of the PNP Special Action Force officers who died in the Mamasapano clash in 2014.


In a separate order, Marcos named three PNP properties in Proclamation No. 430 as follows:




Camp General Paulino T. Santos, Police Regional Office 12


Camp Private Andres P. Dadizon, Police Regional Office 8


Camp 2LT Carlos Rafael Pax Imperial, Police Regional Office 5

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

We thus start off this particular crystal-ball gazing session with an upbeat prediction from Canalys.

Personal computers

According to the technology analyst firm, full-year 2024 personal computer shipments are forecast to hit 267 million units, an eight per cent rise from 2023, helped, the company said, by 'tailwinds including the Windows refresh cycle and emergence of AI-capable and Arm-based devices.'

In a forecast released late last month, Canalys analyst Ben Yeh said the global PC market is on a recovery path, and set to return to 2019 shipment levels by next year. 'The impact of AI on the PC industry will be profound, with leading players across OEMs, processor manufacturers, and operating system providers focused on delivering new AI-capable models in 2024,' he said. 'These initiatives will bolster refresh demand, particularly in the commercial sector.'

The total shipment share of AI-capable PCs, he added, is 'expected to be about 19 per cent in 2024. This accounts for all M-series Mac products alongside the nascent offerings expected in the Windows ecosystem. However, as more compelling use-cases emerge and AI functionality becomes an expected feature, Canalys anticipates a fast ramp up in the development and adoption of AI-capable PCs.'

In a research note released in September, Canalys analyst Keiren Jessop wrote that the 'first deployments of AI-capable PCs to businesses will be limited to specific organization types and employee roles. Examples include research and development, developers, engineers, data analysts and artists.

'These early adopters will take advantage of AI-enabled PCs' faster processing power when working on specific tasks. Game developers will be able to generate entire levels based on a small manually created section that the AI trains itself with.

'Designers can give the AI rough sketches to build and iterate on. Scientists will be able to run complex models faster, as the processing doesn't have to do a round trip to the cloud. Developers and data analysts can use their PCs' AI capabilities to quickly identify trends in their data, all while having total confidence in their security as the data never leaves the devices.'

Israeli forces raided a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities said Wednesday. The Israeli military also expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the territory.

Residents reported shelling and airstrikes in the tiny, cramped enclave, including the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, the southern city of Khan Younis and the southern town of Rafah, where tens of thousands have sought refuge in recent weeks. Much of northern Gaza was pounded to rubble weeks ago.

More than 20,900 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.

About 1,200 people were killed after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, with around 240 people taken hostage. Israel says it aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Currently:

— The U.N. appoints a former Dutch deputy premier and Mideast expert as its Gaza humanitarian coordinator.

— An Israeli airstrike in Syria kills a high-ranking Iranian general.

— Biden orders strikes on an Iranian-aligned group after three U.S. troops are wounded in drone attack in Iraq.

HAMAS IN A SPAT WITH IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD SPOKESMAN

BEIRUT — A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 was launched in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas promptly denied the claim, in a rare public spat between the Palestinian militant group and its main sponsor.

The paramilitary guard's spokesman Ramezan Sharif made the comments at a news conference where he threatened retaliation for the killing of another top Iranian military figure, Gen. Razi Mousavi, who was killed in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria , media=https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/favicon.ico, _id=b99f2f48ffb5b663086108728e17af32}, {wishlistId=290, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Palace renames police camps, PNP lots to honor distinguished officers, author=Jean Mangaluz, link=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880009/palace-renames-police-camps-pnp-lots-to-honor-distinguished-officers, summary=President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. REUTERS file photo


MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the renaming of five Philippine National Police (PNP) camps and lots while giving three other police properties after notable officers, said the Palace on Wednesday.


In Proclamation No. 429, Marcos ordered the renaming of five PNP camps and real properties.

'It is fitting to give honor to former servicemen who have shown patriotism, courage, and dedication in serving the provinces and municipalities to which they are assigned, and distinguished themselves in their service to the nation, by way of naming PNP facilities in their honor,' Marcos said in the order.

The five newly named and renamed offices in the proclamation include:
 


Camp Brigadier General Ludovico Padilla Arejola in Pasacao, Camarines Sur


Camp Captain Salvador Jaucian Del Rosario Sr., in Bicol


Camp Colonel Juan Querubin Miranda (formerly the Camarines Sur Police Provincial Office)


Camp Police Max Jim Ramirez Tria (formerly the 504th Maneuver Company Regional Mobile Force Battalion 5)


Camp Brigadier General Efigenio C. Navarro (formerly the Camp Efiganio C Navaro, Police Regional Office Mimaropa Headquarters)




Notably, Tria was one of the PNP Special Action Force officers who died in the Mamasapano clash in 2014.


In a separate order, Marcos named three PNP properties in Proclamation No. 430 as follows:




Camp General Paulino T. Santos, Police Regional Office 12


Camp Private Andres P. Dadizon, Police Regional Office 8


Camp 2LT Carlos Rafael Pax Imperial, Police Regional Office 5

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

Israeli forces raided a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities said Wednesday. The Israeli military also expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the territory.

Residents reported shelling and airstrikes in the tiny, cramped enclave, including the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, the southern city of Khan Younis and the southern town of Rafah, where tens of thousands have sought refuge in recent weeks. Much of northern Gaza was pounded to rubble weeks ago.

More than 20,900 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.

About 1,200 people were killed after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, with around 240 people taken hostage. Israel says it aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Currently:

— The U.N. appoints a former Dutch deputy premier and Mideast expert as its Gaza humanitarian coordinator.

— An Israeli airstrike in Syria kills a high-ranking Iranian general.

— Biden orders strikes on an Iranian-aligned group after three U.S. troops are wounded in drone attack in Iraq.

HAMAS IN A SPAT WITH IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD SPOKESMAN

BEIRUT — A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 was launched in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas promptly denied the claim, in a rare public spat between the Palestinian militant group and its main sponsor.

The paramilitary guard's spokesman Ramezan Sharif made the comments at a news conference where he threatened retaliation for the killing of another top Iranian military figure, Gen. Razi Mousavi, who was killed in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria , media=https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/favicon.ico, _id=b99f2f48ffb5b663086108728e17af32}, {wishlistId=290, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Palace renames police camps, PNP lots to honor distinguished officers, author=Jean Mangaluz, link=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880009/palace-renames-police-camps-pnp-lots-to-honor-distinguished-officers, summary=President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. REUTERS file photo


MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the renaming of five Philippine National Police (PNP) camps and lots while giving three other police properties after notable officers, said the Palace on Wednesday.


In Proclamation No. 429, Marcos ordered the renaming of five PNP camps and real properties.

'It is fitting to give honor to former servicemen who have shown patriotism, courage, and dedication in serving the provinces and municipalities to which they are assigned, and distinguished themselves in their service to the nation, by way of naming PNP facilities in their honor,' Marcos said in the order.

The five newly named and renamed offices in the proclamation include:
 


Camp Brigadier General Ludovico Padilla Arejola in Pasacao, Camarines Sur


Camp Captain Salvador Jaucian Del Rosario Sr., in Bicol


Camp Colonel Juan Querubin Miranda (formerly the Camarines Sur Police Provincial Office)


Camp Police Max Jim Ramirez Tria (formerly the 504th Maneuver Company Regional Mobile Force Battalion 5)


Camp Brigadier General Efigenio C. Navarro (formerly the Camp Efiganio C Navaro, Police Regional Office Mimaropa Headquarters)




Notably, Tria was one of the PNP Special Action Force officers who died in the Mamasapano clash in 2014.


In a separate order, Marcos named three PNP properties in Proclamation No. 430 as follows:




Camp General Paulino T. Santos, Police Regional Office 12


Camp Private Andres P. Dadizon, Police Regional Office 8


Camp 2LT Carlos Rafael Pax Imperial, Police Regional Office 5

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.

Israeli forces raided a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six Palestinians, Palestinian health authorities said Wednesday. The Israeli military also expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps in the central part of the territory.

Residents reported shelling and airstrikes in the tiny, cramped enclave, including the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, the southern city of Khan Younis and the southern town of Rafah, where tens of thousands have sought refuge in recent weeks. Much of northern Gaza was pounded to rubble weeks ago.

More than 20,900 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.

About 1,200 people were killed after Hamas raided southern Israel on Oct. 7, with around 240 people taken hostage. Israel says it aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.

Currently:

— The U.N. appoints a former Dutch deputy premier and Mideast expert as its Gaza humanitarian coordinator.

— An Israeli airstrike in Syria kills a high-ranking Iranian general.

— Biden orders strikes on an Iranian-aligned group after three U.S. troops are wounded in drone attack in Iraq.

HAMAS IN A SPAT WITH IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD SPOKESMAN

BEIRUT — A spokesman for Iran's Revolutionary Guard claimed Wednesday that the deadly Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7 was launched in retaliation for the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas promptly denied the claim, in a rare public spat between the Palestinian militant group and its main sponsor.

The paramilitary guard's spokesman Ramezan Sharif made the comments at a news conference where he threatened retaliation for the killing of another top Iranian military figure, Gen. Razi Mousavi, who was killed in an alleged Israeli airstrike in Syria , media=https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/favicon.ico, _id=b99f2f48ffb5b663086108728e17af32}, {wishlistId=290, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Palace renames police camps, PNP lots to honor distinguished officers, author=Jean Mangaluz, link=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880009/palace-renames-police-camps-pnp-lots-to-honor-distinguished-officers, summary=President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. REUTERS file photo


MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the renaming of five Philippine National Police (PNP) camps and lots while giving three other police properties after notable officers, said the Palace on Wednesday.


In Proclamation No. 429, Marcos ordered the renaming of five PNP camps and real properties.

'It is fitting to give honor to former servicemen who have shown patriotism, courage, and dedication in serving the provinces and municipalities to which they are assigned, and distinguished themselves in their service to the nation, by way of naming PNP facilities in their honor,' Marcos said in the order.

The five newly named and renamed offices in the proclamation include:

Camp Captain Salvador Jaucian Del Rosario Sr., in Bicol


Camp Colonel Juan Querubin Miranda (formerly the Camarines Sur Police Provincial Office)


Camp Police Max Jim Ramirez Tria (formerly the 504th Maneuver Company Regional Mobile Force Battalion 5)

Notably, Tria was one of the PNP Special Action Force officers who died in the Mamasapano clash in 2014.


In a separate order, Marcos named three PNP properties in Proclamation No. 430 as follows:




Camp General Paulino T. Santos, Police Regional Office 12


Camp Private Andres P. Dadizon, Police Regional Office 8


Camp 2LT Carlos Rafael Pax Imperial, Police Regional Office 5

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.

"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.

PETALING JAYA, Dec 27 (Bernama) -- Representing Malaysia has never crossed the mind of Harimau Malaya squad's newly minted naturalised striker Romale Morales who is among 26 players named by head coach Kim Pan Gon for the 2023 Asian Cup in Doha, Qatar next month.
 
The 26-year-old Colombia-born said he arrived in Malaysia six years ago with many dreams but never expected the opportunity to don the Malaysian jersey, especially ahead for the Asian Cup.
 
 
 
According to the Kuala Lumpur (KL) City FC player, he was grateful to be called up by Pan Gon and is determined to help the team achieve good results in Doha.
 
 
 
"I'm very excited about this great opportunity, this is a new challenge in my career, six years ago I arrived in Malaysia with so many dreams but I never expected something like this, this is great and I'm so grateful for this.
 
"I just want to give my best to help the team and continue doing a great job," he said when met at the national team's training session at Wisma FAM in Kelana Jaya here, today.
 
Commenting further, Morales said that Malaysia is a special country for him and he did not hesitate to accept the invitation to join the Harimau Malaya squad.
 
 
 
"I feel I'm part of this country because I have already experienced so many things here...this is a special country for me, when I got this opportunity I didn't think long to take it," he said.
 
Morales started his career in Malaysia with PKNS FC and featured in the 2018 Super League season before joining KL City to lift the Malaysia Cup in 2021 as well as emerging as runner-up in the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC Cup).
 
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Sikh Izhan Nazrel Sikh Azman also thanked Pan Gon for retaining him since he remains committed and determined to serve the country and gain as much experience as possible in Doha.
 
 
 
The Negeri Sembilan FC player who is among youngsters in the squad, said there was no pressure on his side since Ahmad Syihan Hazmi Mohamed remains the first choice goalkeeper for the Doha outing.
 
'This is the best opportunity for me to gain experience but I must be well prepared to seize such an opportunity, just in case anything happens to the first choice goalkeeper.
 
'To me, Syihan is the first choice, so there is no pressure on me as the reserve keeper...any action will be a valuable experience for me,' said the 21-year-old, media=https://www.bernama.com/storage/photos/c252dd6d97a848803d936ede43913dfc658c13cc98495, _id=0a36adb53b5cf2f97ba3e49207207eef}, {wishlistId=294, emailId=prs_pro@yahoo.com, title=Israel launches heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza after widening its offensive, author=AP News, link=https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/middle-east/3283857/israel-launches-heavy-strikes-across-central-and-southern-gaza-after-widening-its-offensive.html, summary=Israel launched heavy strikes across central and southern Gaza overnight after broadening its offensive against Hamas to more areas where the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.
